One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III",    "These are all the changes made between the 1977, 1997, and 2004 versions:  The scenes where the Stormtroopers are looking through the sand for the  escape pod has extra special effects in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  When the Sandcrawler is climbing over the sand, the angle has changed to  make the machine look much bigger in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  C3PO saying \"We've stopped.\" has been added to the scene where he and R2D2  are in the sand-crawler for the 2004 version.  The binary sunset on Tatooine was made more consistent between shots in the  2004 version.  When Obi-Wan makes a call to scare away the Tusken Raiders, it has been  changed, due to sounding too closely like a dew back scream. In the 2004  version it sounds more like the Boga lizard from Episode III, although it  has always said to be the call of the Krayt Dragon in books and other  sources.  The establishing shot of Obi-Wan Kenobi's home has been expanded with a big  matte painting in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  When Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids overlook Mos Eisley, the 1997 and 2004  versions have a bigger view with more detail.  When the land speeder arrives in Mos Eisley, the 1997 version added extra  effects to make it more real. The 2004 version further enhanced the special  effects with more fluid movement.  Mos Eisley itself has been expanded in the 1997 and 2004 versions with extra  special effects shots, and the strange black blur under the land speeder has  been removed.  In the 1997 version, Greedo shot first during his confrontation with Han  Solo, instead of the other way around. The 2004 version has them shooting  almost at the exact same time.  The 1997 version added a scene of Han talking to a CGI animated Jabba The  Hutt and inserted Boba Fett into the scene as well. The 2004 version  retained this scene but improved the CGI Jabba.  When the Millenium Falcon takes off, extra effects were added into the 1997  and 2004 versions to make it smoother and less static.  In the 2004 version, a line has been added to one of the stormtroopers after  they search the Millenium Falcon to confirm they found nothing.  A larger Alderaan explosion was added in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  C-3PO's line \"The power beam holding the ship is coupled to the main reactor  in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will enable the  ship to leave\" was omitted from the 1981 version, but restored in the 1997  and 2004 versions.  Several laser shots fired in the 1997 and 2004 versions have been censored  to not show the impact.  When one of the stormtroopers bang their head on the door, a sound effect  has been added in the 2004 version.  The cell block corridor has been expanded in the 2004 version.  The Dianogah in the garbage chute has been improved with CGI in the 2004  version, and now blinks.  The writing on the tractor beam has been changed in the 2004 version to  Aurabesh.  When Luke and Leia are running from the stormtroopers and find themselves at  a dead end, there is extra echo effect added into the 2004 version.  When Han runs down the corridor and is confronted by stormtroopers, the 1997  and 2004 versions had a whole room full of them.  When Han and Chewie are running from the stormtroopers, the 1997 and 2004  versions add an extra small line for Han.  The light sabers in the Obi-Wan/Darth Vader fight have been cleaned up in  the 2004 version. The 2004 version also corrects a shot from shortly after  the fight where Darth Vader's light saber had not been colored by the  effects crew. It now appears red as it should be.  In the 1997 and 2004 versions, we actually see the Millenium Falcon when it  is arriving at the rebel base, and the huge doors are moving now instead of  stationary.  There is a small conversation between Luke and his friend Biggs before they  go into battle.  When the Rebels launch to go into attack, the 1997 and 2004 versions have  added more special effects.  A shot of the Rebel fleet in space has been expanded in the 1997 and 2004  versions and the camera now moves with the X-Wings.  The line \"He's ON Your Tail\" was added for the 1997 version but removed  again for the 2004 version.  The Death Star explosion is expanded in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  Many matte lines have been removed throughout the 1997 and 2004 versions and  other similar optical improvements have been made. The overall video and  audio quality has also been improved in each version, sometimes with changes  to some sound effects.",   "The 2006 DVD reissue contains a \"bonus disc\" which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's \"tractor beam description\" and Stormtrooper \"close the blast doors\" lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD.",     "The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the \"A New Hope\" subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date.",      "In 1977, \"Ken Films\" released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company \"Derran\" released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies).",         "The German \"marketing film\" released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German \"UFA\" released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the \"marketing film\" version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US \"Ken Films\" version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the \"marketing/UFA\"-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes.",       "In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films.",         "When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: \"I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.\"",  "Stills from the \"lost\" Tatooine scenes have been published (in \"The Star Wars Storybook\", for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars'\".  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story.",     "David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten black-and-white workprint of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit. All the landspeeder, Millennium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded. The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes.",         "There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases:  The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the  Battle of Yavin is very different.  On TV, Luke says \"Blast it, Wedge, where are you?\"  On the video he says,  \"Blast it, Biggs, where are you?\"  On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out.  On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, \"This one's  secure, move onto the next one\".  On the video he says 'locked' instead of  secure.",       "The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the \"close the blast doors\" line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line \"All his friends have gone\" places emphasis on \"friends\" rather than \"gone\" in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts \"Blast it, Wedge, where are you?\" rather than \"Blast it, Biggs, where are you?\" Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected.",   "The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases \"twenty percent\" and \"fifteen percent\" are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as \"20%\" and \"15%,\" to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version.",       "The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints.",         "In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say \"Open the blast door. Open the blast door\" as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say \"Close the blast door\" before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was \"lost\" on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled \"The Story of Star Wars.\" This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The \"close the blast doors\" line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special \"George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic\" on the PBS series _\"American Masters\" (1983)_.",  "The \"lost scenes\" from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the \"Behind the Magic\" CD-ROM-discs.",    "In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. \"Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you\" was split into \"Jabba put a price so big on your head...\" followed by, \"every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.\"",       "The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music. John Williams' score is de-emphasized considerably throughout, and during the minute or two of the climactic battle, it is completely inaudible." ], "certificates" : [      "Argentina:Atp",        "Australia:PG", "Brazil:Livre",  "Canada:G\t(British Columbia/Quebec)",  "Canada:PG\t(Manitoba/Ontario)",         "Canada:A\t(Nova Scotia) (original rating)",    "Canada:PG\t(Nova Scotia) (special edition)",    "Chile:TE",     "Denmark:12",   "Denmark:11\t(special edition)",         "Finland:K-12\t(original rating)",      "Finland:K-8\t(special edition)",        "France:U",     "Germany:6\t(special edition)",         "Hong Kong:I",   "Iceland:L\t(original rating)",         "Iceland:LH\t(original version) (video re-rating)",      "Iceland:L\t(special edition)",         "Ireland:G",     "Italy:T",      "Malaysia:U",   "Mexico:AA",    "Netherlands:AL",       "Netherlands:12\t(DVD rating)",  "New Zealand:PG",       "Norway:12",    "Norway:11\t(special edition)",  "Peru:PT",      "Portugal:M/12",        "Singapore:PG\t(special edition)",       "South Africa:PG",      "South Korea:All",      "Spain:T",       "Sweden:11",    "UK:U",         "USA:PG\t(certificate #24925)",         "West Germany:12\t(original rating)" ], "color_info" : [  "Color\t(Technicolor)" ], "country" : [  "USA" ], "distributors" : [    "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Japan [jp]\t(1995) (Japan) (video) (laserdisc)",    "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Japan [jp]\t(1997) (Japan) (video) (laserdisc)",    "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment [de]\t(1995) (Germany) (video) (laserdisc)",        "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment [fr]\t(1997) (France) (video) (laserdisc)",         "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment [se]\t(????)

Thus in the new, CG Special Edition shots, Luke's X-Wing incorrectly has two red stripes on each wing (instead of five), and the Falcon has the two extra landing gear bays on its underside it didn't *originally* have until Empire (it also has a slightly different paint scheme).",     "CONT: In the escape from Tatooine, Chewbacca'a sash disappears and reappears between shots.",   "FAKE: When Princess Leia grabs the bar to stop the compactor, her hand puts a dent in the bar itself.",         "FAKE: After Vader strikes down Obi-Wan by the hangar door inside the Death Star, Vader's lightsaber is revealed only as a white stick.

The next time we see her part of her fringe is falling across her forehead, and in the shot after that it is back in place.",      "FAKE: When Obi-Wan activates his lightsaber to fight Vader, he is clearly just holding the saber so the long end points directly at the camera, and rotating it slowly to create the illusion of the blade appearing.",  "CREW: When the Falcon is on approach to the Death Star's docking bay, you can see the support prop under the vehicle. This was not corrected on the DVD releases.",       "CONT: When the Death Star is approaching the Yavin Base to superlaser it, the times to arrival at the laser firing point don't even come close to matching the ones on the clock on the monitor of the control room.",   "FAKE: In the 2004 edition, in the duel between Vader and Ben, Vader's bright red lightsaber is not reflected on his mask.",      "CONT: Even after Darth Vader's TIE's laser hits R2, he appears undamaged for the rest of the Battle of Yavin. He doesn't even appear damaged until the return to the base following the Death Star's destruction.",       "FAKE: In the Special Edition, when Luke and Obi-Wan first enter Mos Eisley, the shadows (real and CGI) indicate the sun is near overhead. However, the large CGI beast that is passed has a shadow that indicates it is several hours later. Shadows appear consistent after that.",      "SYNC: During the heroes' procession into the award ceremony, the assembled rebel soldiers turn (either left-face or right-face, depending on which side of the aisle they were standing), accompanied by the appropriate sound of their feet stomping to complete the movement.

His head movements change from shot to shot as he is exposed when Luke is playing with the lightsaber.", "CONT: The restraining bolt placed on R2-D2 by the Jawas moves between scenes.", "FAKE: The technical data that R2D2 uploads to the Rebels shows a schematic image of the Death Star with at the \"laser divot\" along the equator of the Death Star, not off-center like it was constructed. This is because the schematics were from different concept art of the Death Star not used in the final movie version.",        "FAKE: When Han puts his feet on the control board where Kenobi leaves them you can see that the boots of his storm trooper armor are really just normal leather work boots painted white.You can see the elastic fabric on the sides of the boots are still there.",      "FAKE: Most of the times, when Luke or Ben ignite or deactivate a lightsaber, the saber is not shown igniting or deactivating; just the sound effect his heard. And the times when it IS shown, even though it is supposed to be one shot, the character or his/her body part is in a slightly different location after the weapon is ignited than before the weapon is ignited, indicating two separate shots.",    "FAIR: After Greedo is killed in the Cantina we see him again crossing a street in the distance as Han and Luke are walking down the street. However, it's probably another alien of the same species, and they just look alike.",         "FAIR: Considering what we now know from Star Wars 1-3, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 and C3PO? We know C3PO's memory was wiped, so he wouldn't remember Obi-Wan, but Obi-Wan should remember R2D2, and vice-versa. However, there's no indication that he doesn't remember R2D2, he only says that he doesn't remember \"owning a droid\", which is actually true to some extent. (See also the FAQ entry about this issue.)",  "FAIR: When telling Obi-Wan and Luke how fast the Millennium Falcon is, Han says it \"made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs.\" A parsec is not a measure of time. It is a measure of distance (approximately 3.26 light years or just over 19 trillion miles.) However, he was actually referring to the shorter route he was able to travel by skirting the nearby Maw black hole cluster, thus making the run in under the standard distance.",  "FAKE: When Luke tries to put the handcuffs on Chewie in the Death Star control room, you can see two holes in Chewie's mouth that let 'Peter Mayhew (II)' (qv) breathe through the costume.",     "CONT: After Leia blasts a hole into the garbage chamber and jumps in, Chewbacca begins to step into the hole. The shot cuts to Luke, but when it cuts back to Chewie he is once again beginning to step into the hole.", "CREW: When 3PO is arguing with R2D2 about which direction they should walk, the camera and the dolly track are reflected in 3PO's helmet.",      "CONT: During the assault on the Death Star, all the pilot's voices are distorted when heard over their intercom. That is until Luke takes charge. From that moment, all the intercom voices are crystal clear.",  "CREW: Part of 'Kenny Baker (I)' (qv)'s face visible through R2-D2's eye in the Sandcrawler.",   "FAKE: Shot of Princess Leia and C-3PO monitoring the Rebels' attack on the Death Star has been reversed.",      "FAKE: The shot of R2-D2 being prepped for reading the Death Star plans is a mirror image.",      "FAKE: The shot of Darth Vader dueling Ben and saying \"You should not have come back\" is a mirror image - the three silver buttons on his chest plate are on the right instead of the left.",   "FAKE: After C-3PO and R2-D2 split up on Tatooine, C-3PO has an oil streak down his right side. When he comes across the large skeleton in the sand, the oil streak has switched to the left (film was flipped). When he is calling and waving to the Sandcrawler, the oil is back on the right side.",     "FAKE: Vader kills Captain Raymus Antilles, and throws his body into a wall. The \"dead\" man puts his hands out to protect himself from the impact.",    "SYNC: It is frequently claimed that upon returning to the Rebel base after destroying the Death Star, Luke exclaims, \"Carrie!\" when he hears Leia ('Carrie Fisher (I)' (qv)) call \"Luke!\" Sound designer 'Ben Burtt' (qv) has confirmed that, after extensive listening, it appears to be \"Hey\" or \"Yay\"; 'Mark Hamill' reports that he said, \"Hey! There she is!\" but mumbled the last word. Yet, trained lip readers report only two syllables being spoken and they look like Carrie.",         "CREW: When Han Solo is arguing with Jabba the Hutt, Jabba yells: \"Come on!\" and jerks to the left. As he jerks, we see dark crescent-moon object: 'Declan Mulholland' (qv)'s head, not fully covered by the animated figure of Jabba that was superimposed later. Since Jabba was re-animated for the 2004 DVD release, that is the only time it is seen.",      "FAIR: During the skirmish at the beginning of the movie, C3PO says to R2D2 \"there will be no escape for the Princess this time.\" (The script reads \"There'll be no escape for the Captain this time,\" foreshadowing the next scene where Vader strangles the Captain.) Later, C3PO sees a picture of the Princess and claims not to know who she is. It's likely that it was programmed not to divulge any important information that may endanger the mission of the Princess.",        "FAKE: In the Special Edition, as a figure passes in front of Luke and Biggs in the rebel hangar, R2D2's position jumps as he is being lifted up to the top of the X-Wing fighter (right side of the frame). This is a result of editing out a section of the scene where Red Leader mentions having known Luke's father. The passing figure is intended to mask the edit, but the jump in R2's position reveals the edit. This is mainly evident in the widescreen format.",         "FAIR: When Obi-Wan talks to Luke about the force for the first time, there's no mention of \"midichlorians\" because they didn't exist back in 1977, when this movie first came out. It's clear 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) had a good overall idea of where he wanted his story to go, however it's also clear that many little details, including midichlorians, were added later on. Obi-Wan doesn't mention them here because Lucas hadn't thought them up yet. From the character's point of view, midichlorians are trivial and not significant enough to mention.",        "FAKE: (Special Edition) On the morning after R2's escape the image fades up to reveal the deserted courtyard of the homestead. Uncle Owen is heard calling for Luke who, as we find out a few seconds later, has already left with his Landspeeder in order to look for the missing droid. However, a close inspection of the courtyard shot reveals a ghost-like image of Luke in a doorway to the right. He seems frozen in mid-stride and has been slightly blended into the surrounding set, thereby turning somewhat transparent. This strange cameo is not featured in the original release.",  "FAKE: On Tatooine when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking (and Rolling) away from the Escape Pod, you can clearly see the hatch is off and is blue. Clearly meant to be edited but never filled.",      "CHAR: In the music in the ending credits, a trumpet overblows and hits a wrong note",   "FAIR: Some viewers have noted that the Jawas' eyes are obviously just light bulbs. However, in this fictional universe it is possible that Jawas' eyes have coincidentally evolved to look like light-bulbs.",    "FAIR: In the lightsaber fight between Vader and Obi Wan, 'David Prowse (I)' (qv)'s eyes are visible through the Darth Vader helmet lenses. However, this is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask.",         "FAIR: When Vader is in his TIE Fighter in the Battle of Yavin, more than once you can see the eyes and eyebrows of 'David Prowse (I)' (qv) through the visors on Vader's mask. This is not an error because Darth Vader is a man (Anakin Skywalker), and as seen at the end of Return of the Jedi, Vader's face is still intact with fully functional eyes, which could understandably be revealed through his mask. In this film the lenses of Vader's mask are a deep red color which is not visible through most of the film -- the lighting requirements in this scene are likely what made the lenses more transparent. In the subsequent films, the lenses were probably changed to a black color to compensate.",        "FAIR: During the Death Star battle, you hear: \"Red 6, can you see Red 5?\" and a voice seems to answer. This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls. The response was likely an irrelevant call that just happened to be sent at an inopportune moment.",  "SYNC: Back in the hangar bay on Yavin after the destruction of the Death Star, as Luke, Han and Leia are jubilant, C-3PO rushes to the side of Luke's X-wing.

Obi Wan Kenobi then turns on his lightsaber and proceeds to cut one of the criminal's arm off. Then there is a closeup of the severed arm and there is blood on the ground. Lightsabers usually \"seal\" the cuts they make allowing no blood to come out.",      "FAKE: Upon their arrival at the Yavin Base, we see Luke, Leia, and Han Solo get off of the little car. Han Solo's gun is now strapped to his left leg, thus indicating a reverse shot.", "CHAR: Luke Skywalker tells his aunt and uncle he wants to go to the \"Academy\", but the Academy is an Imperial institution - this makes little sense when he later specifically tells Obi-Wan he hates the Empire (Luke's motivation is hinted at in deleted scenes from the film, in which friends of him talk about joining the Academy and \"jumping ship\" to run off and join the Rebellion, but the remark is left making little sense in the final released film.)",         "CHAR: On the detention level, the stormtroopers blast a hole through the elevator door and all come out through there, which would negate any chance of any other troopers coming up.",   "CONT: Direction of the shadows changes several times by almost 180 degrees between shots when R2D2 and C3PO are sold to Owen.

In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy.",    "by" : "Michael Daly" } ], "taglines" : [        "It's Back!

Hammond wanted to create the illusion that all of the animals were, in fact, created on Isla Nublar. It isn't until The Lost World that it was revealed that Site B on Isla Sorna was where the large industrial compound producing thousands of embryos for a single viable one was located. This is explained in the novel but not mentioned in any of the movies.",  "FAKE: The trailer at the archaeological dig where Hammond meets Grant and Sattler is no doubt a (highway-legal) 8 feet in width as seen from the outside, but the \"champagne\" scene which follows takes place in a cavernous mock-up much wider to accommodate workbenches, a full-size refrigerator, etc.",    "FAIR: In the scene in the control room where Mr. Arnold says that \"fences are failing all over the park\", you can clearly see on the computer screen that the raptor paddock fences are included. Later John asks \"the raptor fences aren't out are they?\" Mr. Arnold tells him that they are still on. However, earlier in the movie it was stated that the velociraptors had to be contained in a separate holding pen - which is shown in the movie - away from the paddock shown on the map.",        "FAIR: The \"Dilophosaurus\" in the film had a retractable frill around its neck and was able to spit poison, aiming for the eyes to blind and paralyze its prey. While there is no evidence to support this representation, in the film it's stated when the group is on the tour and approach the holding facility of the Dilophosaurus, the announcer states that recently, they discovered that the venom and the frill were part of what it was capable of. Meaning, clearly the \"facts\" were just simply exaggerated for the film, since they came upon discovering this through bringing it to life, when, outside of the film, of course that never happened. It was probably added for dramatic effect for the later scene when Dennis would encounter the dinosaur.",        "PLOT: It is quite unlikely that a really important room like the control room doesn't have a manual (or at least an independently powered) lock which would be operational in the event of a power outage.",      "PLOT: When Tim and Lex arrive at the visitor center, after their \"tour\", they find a entire buffet set with desserts. But all personnel left the night before and only the people in the control-room have been around. Hammond and Ellie ate dessert the night before, but it should have gone bad or melted until the children arrived. No staff of the kitchen seem present or around either. To leave all this food out seem without logic.

This is an obvious joke at Gennaro's expense.",         "FAKE: When Dennis slides down the bank (waterfall) you can see a section of it that has been cut to make a sort of slide for him to go down. It is unlikely to be a storm gutter, plus Dennis manages to slip exactly where it is.",      "FAKE: When Gennaro leaves the driver-side door open and runs away, Timmy goes to close the door and you can see the cover for the seat belt next to the driver-side window but no seat belt is visible. Once Timmy closes the door and you look out the driver-side window, the cover is missing; all you see is the opening where the cover would be installed.",         "FAKE: When the Jeep is being chased by the T-Rex, the camera goes to the driver's side mirror showing the T-Rex and \"Objects in mirror are closer than they appear\". This phrase is only needed for mirrors with convex glass (used to allow the driver to have a wider viewing range and found on the passenger side of the vehicle), which the driver's side mirror does not have (it uses a piece of flat glass).",     "FAKE: During lunch, the characters eat in a round room with projectors displaying slides on the opposite wall, around the room. The diners and the wait staff would be in the projector beams, but cast no shadows on the screens. The images are obviously rear-projection.",    "CONT: When they arrive at the T. rex cage right before the black out, we can clearly see the ground inside the cage is approximately flush with that outside the cage. But when the T. rex escapes and begins to terrorize the two trucks, the ground in the cage is shown to be at least 100 feet below where it was before.",    "CHAR: As Dr. Grant lectures the cynical boy at the dig site about the velociraptor, he says that the velociraptor's claw was used to eviscerate and tear its victims apart, as opposed to going for the neck like many of today's predators. The fossilized remains of a velociraptor caught in a feud with its prey clearly show the velociraptor stabbing the prey in the neck with its claw. _\"The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs\" (2005)_ (qv) also conducted an experiment to see if the claw could eviscerate flesh. It couldn't.",    "FAIR: Dr. Grant is shown at the beginning of the film excavating a velociraptor in Montana. True velociraptors have only been found in central Asia, but Montana was home to the closely related Deinonychus, which some paleontologists considered to be the same as Velociraptor at the time the original Jurassic Park novel was written. For the movie, they kept the incorrect name.",         "CONT: In the trailer / champagne scene, the amount of dust on Grant's forehead changes between between shots from 3/4 covered to fully covered, back to 3/4 and finally none.",  "CREW: When Dr. Grant and Tim are choosing which car to sit in at the visitors center two stage lights can be seen reflecting in the open car door.",     "FAKE: As the Ford Explorer that has just chased Grant and Tim down the tree topples over and smashes onto the floor, the huge tree root on the right of the shot moves showing it's not a tree root at all and doesn't go into the ground it's just resting on the floor.",        "FAKE: In the scene where the T. rex flips the Jeep over the viewer can see a floodlight in the background being hidden by a tree. The tree which hides the light still sits in a large pot, although it should be planted.",      "FAKE: When the T. rex spins the upside down Explorer, in one shot a wire is visible connected to the vehicle. It is in the shot where the animatronics legs are visible.",       "FAKE: When the T. rex attacks the herd of Gallimimus, one of them leaps up toward the T. rex and the Gallimimus' top half disappears into the T. rex' body for a second.",       "CREW: When Dr. Grant is holding the door shut in the control room, just as the velociraptor pushes the door almost fully open you can see a crew member in a white shirt reflected in the glass opposite the door. The crew member seems to be pushing the velociraptor model against the door to force it open.",         "CONT: When the T. rex breaks out through the fence its first move shows it walking in between the two explorers away from the characters, which would give it no cause to have any interest with the explorers. In the following scene, the T. rex is shown at the fence again.",         "PLOT: The plot centers around finding dinosaur blood in fossilized mosquitoes trapped in amber. However, our first encounter with extinct life comes when Ellie examines a leaf and says \"This 'veriforman' species has been extinct since the Cretaceous.\" No mechanism is provided for how they could have cloned the plants, given that mosquitoes don't drink plant juices. It is possible that DNA could have been extracted from the amber (hardened tree-sap), but this still doesn't account for other types of plants, such as ferns and bushes.",         "FAKE: SPOILER: As the T. rex rears its head up with the Velociraptor in its mouth, the raptor disappears completely for just a moment, then pops back into view.",       "FAIR: When leaving the visitor coach to proceed to the laboratory, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, and Dr. Malcolm have to push hard to lift their retaining clips which keep them on their seats during the ride, yet Hammond and Gennaro are able to lift theirs easily. As shown earlier, Hammond is holding the remote control for the seat restraints; all he had to do was push a button to release the locks.",      "SYNC: As Hammond was hearing the shotgun fire through the telephone, we can hear that what was firing was like a pistol the bangs and the rate of fire. Shotguns usually have a slower rate of fire and sound far more louder than a pistol, and when the shot goes to the glass behind the \"ride\" it looked like holes from 9mm pistol rounds instead of .12 guage shotgun rounds.",     "SYNC: When the T. rex is attacking the car with Lex and Tim, in a shot through the roof wind-shield, you can hear them scream. However, their mouths stay closed.",      "PLOT: When the T. rex first gets out, it claws open the fence and walks through the opening; however, when Dr. Grant and Lex go through the same spot in the fence, there is a significant drop (large enough for a jeep to drop past them and into a tree that Dr. Grant then climbs to rescue Tim). The dropoff that Dr. Grant and the kids scale down would have made the fence too tall for the T. rex to reach or even see.",  "FACT: The mosquito that is encased in amber, and from which the DNA sample is extracted is male. This is evident from the \"bushy\" look of the antennae. Female mosquitoes have far fewer hairs on their antennae, and so the distinction is easily made. Only females drink blood, as it is needed to produce eggs. There would not have been any dinosaur DNA in the male to extract.",  "CONT: During the tour group's first stop at the tyrannosaur paddock, rain appears and disappears from the vehicle windows between shots.",       "FAKE: From the control room, Hammond sees Malcolm speaking to him through a surveillance camera apparently mounted in the vehicle. Interior shots of the vehicles, however, show no evidence of cameras anywhere in the vehicles, particularly the part that Malcolm appears to have been looking at. Early concept art for the film did show where the cameras would be, but the final design does not appear to include them.",   "FAKE: A number of obvious goofs from the Dilophosaurus sequence: - Before it opens up its frill, you can see nothing on the animal's   neck that would suggest is has a frill. It simply appears from one   shot to the next. - As the animal opens up its frill, you can see the wire that held   the frill down being quickly pulled back. You can also notice a   curiously narrow area around the neck - that's where the wire was   wrapped around it in the beginning of the shot. - When the frill is fully opened, it flops around a lot. In the next   shot, it is resting firmly on the animal's neck, suggesting it is   either another prop, or has been attached more firmly between   takes.",   "CONT: As the T. rex was destroying the Explorer that Tim and Lex were in, in one shot, their clothes are nice and clean, and the next, they're filthy with mud.", "CREW: The video cameras in front of the steering wheel in the Ford Explorer are actually supposed to be used for the audience to see out the windshield. Even on the front bumper guard, there are video cameras, probably used for crew members to drive the vehicle from behind the backseat. When the camera zooms up to the main Jurassic Park gate, there is clearly a tiny camera on top of the driver's side windshield panel. Ian literally found this camera out after the people were looking at the T. rex paddock.",     "FAKE: When the T. rex flips the car with the children in it over, you can see a plant in a flower pot.",        "SYNC: When Ray Arnold uses the UNIX command prompt to access the park's security system his spoken commands do not match his typed commands. For example the first typed command is \"access security\" and the first spoken command is \"access main program\". None of his spoken commands match the commands entered in the prompt.",   "CHAR: The command prompt used by Ray Arnold while attempting to access security settings appears to have correctly started in normal user mode, as the prompt symbol is simply a \">\" character. He would have to enable superuser mode, often indicated by a \"#\" symbol, to access important system information such as security settings. Perhaps the enable command was \"please.\"",         "FACT: In the first scene where the Ford Explorers pull up and Mr. Hammond brags about the cars, the boy Tim climbs inside and if you look closely you can see there is no seat belts in the vehicle. The restraints were cut because the vehicle could not be involved in a traffic collision due to the track system. Then, when the T. rex flips the Explorer over, the kids do no fall from their seats because they were wearing some sort of restraints.",      "CHAR: In the scripted audio tour, the narrator refers to the dilophosaurus as poisonous, when in fact if the method of toxin exchange is spitting or biting, then it is actually venomous.",     "CONT: As the gas Jeeps travel through the park from the heliport to the visitors center, their tops are configured to be completely open air. As Dr. Grant sees the brachiosaurus for the first time, he reaches up to grab the Jeep's roll bar to stand. The Jeep's canopy covering the front seat passengers is closed. Seconds later when he reaches down the turn Dr. Sattler's head to the left it's open again.",     "FAIR: After shooting the velociraptor, Grant drops the shotgun on the ground, with the action open and the ejection port facing up. There is a shell visible halfway out of the receiver. This is probably why Grant stops trying to shoot the attacking raptors and drops the gun, precisely because of this \"stovepipe\" jam (assuming that he is not accustomed to firearms and therefore doesn't know racking the action would probably solve the problem).",   "FAKE: When Muldoon, Ellie, and Malcolm are being chased by the T. rex, the rex moves towards Malcolm (seated in the back) and Malcolm leans back fast in fright, moving the gear stick from fourth to third gear.

The  Paths of the Dead sequence is heavily revised, including the appearance of  thousands of skulls, wispy ghosts, an earthquake and Aragorn's emergence  from the mountain.  t) We see Gothmog dismounting a warg as the siege of Gondor begins;  additional action during the siege of Gondor, including the Orcs using a  small battering ram on the gates and cheering on the approach of the huge  battering ram, Grond.  u) A new scene in which Aragorn attacks the Corsair ships, which includes a  cameo by Peter Jackson (he's the one killed by Legolas).  v) A scouting report is brought to Theoden on his way to Gondor; a  conversation between Merry and Eowyn.  w) More footage as Denethor takes Faramir to be cremated alive.  x) As Gandalf is riding to rescue Faramir, he is attacked by the Witch King.  y) The charge of the Rohirrim is moved to after this scene.  z) Another line of dialog before Denethor lights his pyre.  aa) More action during the battle of the Pelennor, including a fight between  Gothmog and Eowyn.  bb) After Eowyn kills the Witch King, Gothmog tries to finish her off.  cc) Pippin's search for Merry is much longer and he finds him at night.  dd) Eomer finds Eowyn on the field and mourns when he thinks she is dead. A  restored healing sequence between Aragorn and Eowyn.  ee) A much longer fight among the Orcs in the tower of Cirith Ungol.  ff) After Sam rescues Frodo, we see a surviving Orc sneaking off with the  Mithril shirt.  gg) Aragorn finds a Palantir in the White Tower and uses it to reveal  himself to Sauron.  hh) Faramir and Eowyn meet in Minas Tirith after Aragorn leaves.  ii) Frodo and Sam, wearing a disguise of orc armor, are found and forced to  march with a detachment of Orcs while trying to reach Mount Doom.  jj) Near Mt. Doom, Frodo and Sam throw away the last of their gear.  kk) While resting, Sam sees a star through the clouds.  ll) At the Black Gate, the Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Pippin, Merry,  and Eomer are first confronted by the Mouth of Sauron.

Not only are they on top of an erupting volcano, but they are also in Mordor, which as both the books and films would have us believe, is a arid, barren, and totally dry location. However, as Frodo runs up the hill, there is clearly trickling water in the background, indicating a large stream.",         "PLOT: When Gandalf rides out, using the light of his staff to ward off the fell beasts so Faramir's team can get back to Minas Tirith, you see that Pippin is on the horse with him, even though there would have been no reason to bring him along. The reason is that this scene was originally filmed to coincide with Gandalf and Pippin's arrival at Minas Tirith, but was pushed further back as the story evolved.",         "CONT: Right after Éowyn and Merry saying \"to battle\", there's a scene where a trebuchet is throwing a fiery rock into Minas Tirith.

His Starfleet phaser has switched to a Romulan gun (longer barrel and no lights), before switching back to the Starfleet one again in the next scene. He actually acquires the Romulan gun a few scenes later.",     "CONT: When Nero is told that Spock has destroyed the drill and Nero yells, \"Spock,\" Nero's left ear is the one missing its tip instead of his right ear. (This shot was obviously reversed in editing.)",      "CONT: When the crew is discussing the plan to beam aboard Nero's ship, Ensign Chekov states that, in order to arrive in time, they will need Mr. Scott to get them to Warp factor 4; however, the HUD on the view-screen behind the group clearly shows the ship to already be traveling at a speed in excess of Warp 4.3.",       "CONT: SPOILER: When the Romulans attack Earth, you can see the flame coming down on the seaport near Starfleet, creating a giant circular wave. But in close-up, there's no wave at all, just water evaporating.",        "FAIR: SPOILER: The Romulan ship managed to reach Earth and start drilling without Starfleet attacking because the primary fleet was in the Laurentian system, and only 7 ships were sent to Vulcan because they were all the available ships. Additionally, Captain Pike was forced to give Starfleet defense codes when the slug was attached to his brain stem. When Nero arrived at Earth, he was able to do so without alerting any Earth defenses.",    "FAIR: The \"Enterprise\" is referred to as Star Fleet's new flagship. While in current naval tradition a flagship requires an admiral on board, Starfleet has been established as having a premier starship referred to as a \"flagship.\" In _\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" (1987)_ (qv), the Enterprise 1701-D was referred to as the Flagship of the Federation.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: In the final \"Spock on Spock\" scene, you can see the obvious height difference between the two. Young Spock should be the same height as old Spock. However, Vulcan biology is not fully understood and this could simply be a natural physical change. Additionally, this is consistent with human physiology. Old Spock is 120 years older than young Spock so it is natural that young Spock is taller. As humans age, their spines become more curved and the cartilage in between the vertebrae become more compacted; hence they tend to be shorter. This height difference can be quite considerable so a handful of inches is really not unusual. In addition, it should also be noted that both the actors, 'Leonard Nimoy' (qv) and 'Zachary Quinto' (qv), both stand the exact same height in real life, 6'1\". So the height difference on-screen could be intentional, to show the aging of Older Spock.",  "CONT: When Kirk first lands on the drill, he removes his helmet and throws it to the side and engages a Romulan in hand-to-hand combat. Several seconds later during a pan-out, we see Kirk hitting another Romulan in the head with the helmet he earlier threw off to the side, even though there would be no time for him to retrieve it from across the platform.",     "FAIR: Chekov's Russian accent is sometimes perceived to have a major flaw in it. In Russian, there is no \"W\" sound, but there is a very, very common \"V\" sound (although heavily rounded with shades of \"w\"). As a result of this, his labored way of transforming his V's into W's might seem incorrect, but when speaking English, native Russian speakers will sometimes transpose V's and W's, e.g. \"Ve are wery happy to be here\". (A similar phenomenon is seen in speakers of Asian languages that possess only either \"L\" or \"R\", when speaking in English will often transpose them: \"really\" becomes \"leary\".) In any event, this is clearly a nod to 'Walter Koenig (I)' (qv)'s portrayal of Chekov in the original _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) series and most notably in _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)_ (qv), when Chekov is seen in 20th Century San Francisco asking for directions to \"nuclear wessels\".",      "FAIR: Mr. Scott says he had a transporter mishap with \"Admiral Archer's prized beagle\". The series _\"Enterprise\" (2001)_ (qv) with Archer was set around 100 years before the events of the movie. The Scotty scene takes place in 2258. Enterprise was set in 2151-2155 meaning Archer would be around 140-150 years old. _Star Trek (2009)_ (qv) writer 'Roberto Orci' (qv) went on record to clear up the issue: \"Admiral Archer is a reference to the Archer we all know and love, from the TV series and yes he would be over 100, which is a likely life expectancy in a futuristic space faring race of humans\" (as depicted by McCoy in _\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" (1987) {Encounter at Farpoint (#1.1)}_ (qv).)",       "FAKE: When Kirk is making out with Uhura's green skinned roommate Gaila, you can see green make-up on the front of his boxers (and a little on his skin above the boxers) when he first lifts himself from on top of her for some dialog. After the scene cuts to another camera angle and then back to Kirk, the green coloring is no longer visible on Kirk.",    "FAIR: SPOILER: When the Kelvin encountered the Narada, the latter was emerging from a black hole, thus the \"lightning storm in space\". Before it started to attack Vulcan, there was another \"lightning storm in space\"; this was the arrival of Spock Prime's vessel, the Jellyfish.",       "FAIR: In _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv), Captain Kirk mentions a Federation/Romulan War many years previously. The war was conducted through starship battles and the treaty for it was negotiated via subspace radio, so Romulans and Federation citizens never saw each other prior to that point in time. This means that the Federation knew about the Romulans and general background information about their ships (what radio frequencies were used, power signatures, etc.) long before the scene with the USS Kelvin in the movie which resulted in altering later history.",   "FAIR: SPOILER: Some viewers have commented that the Nero/Spock confrontation that sends them through the black hole occurred immediately following the destruction of Romulus. The comic series \"Star Trek: Countdown\" makes it clear that there was a time passage of around a week or so, during which Nero upgraded his ship significantly with BORG technology as part of his revenge scheme. Although comic co-writer Mike Johnson considers Countdown to be canon, screenwriter Robert Orci has stated he is no position to declare whether it is, though he feels it could be considered canon unless it is contradicted in a later film or TV episode. However, he has since implied that it was not canon.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: Chekov obtained transporter lock on Kirk and Sulu because the transponders in their communicators helped him lock onto their biosignal, which was moving at a predictable velocity. However, losing transporter lock on Spock's mother was a different story. Whether from the lack of communicators or Vulcan's unique geology, transporter lock on the Science Council was only possible above ground. Unlike with Kirk and Sulu, her fall was a complete surprise, and her biosignal was masked by interference from the cliff walls and the debris engulfing her body. In addition, while Amanda clearly demonstrated that people can move within the field of a transport in progress, she literally fell out of the transport-in-progress's field when the cliff collapsed. She was already being molecularly disassembled for transport. Compare this to Kirk and Sulu's transport; in that instance, Kirk and Sulu were already in motion and Chekov was already working on maintaining the lock while Kirk and Sulu were transported aboard.",      "CONT: In the high altitude parachute jump, the display on Chekov's screen showing the order of jumpers (Olson, Kirk, Sulu) does not match actual order (Kirk, Olson, Sulu) until the first chutes deploy.",      "FAIR: SPOILER: Spock Prime is surprised that Kirk is not yet Captain of the Enterprise. In his time line, he served under Captain Pike's command of the Enterprise for ten years, and Kirk became Captain after that time. He should know that Kirk is too young to be Captain. However Spock may not know the actual date yet - so far he's been abducted by Nero and abandoned on a planet near Vulcan, and although he's aware of a nearby Starfleet outpost, he's not been there yet.",  "CONT: When they plan to sneak up on the Narada, Mr. Scott is holding a towel with both hands, but when they zoom up closer, he is holding it to his side.",      "CONT: SPOILER: During the awards ceremony, several flags can be seen in the background, including what appears to be the state flag of California. Towards the end of the sequence, the point of view shifts to Spock Prime viewing from a balcony, and the flags are changed to Federation and Starfleet flags.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: When Nero is accused of genocide after destroying Vulcan, he responds that he is trying to prevent it. He knows he has gone back in time, and he has the red matter, which he knows can destroy the supernova. He also knows from his own actions that it's possible to change the time line he is from. If he truly wants to prevent genocide, why does he not go to the star and eliminate it decades before it can destroy Romulus? This is in part because Nero also states that he wishes to eliminate the Federation since it is the primary nemesis of Romulus. Nero may have decided to destroy the Federation before saving his home world, since the supernova is not scheduled to take place for a hundred years. (It should also be noted that Nero is not exactly a picture of mental health, after having witnessed the destruction of his entire planet, travelling through a black hole and spending upwards of 25 years in prison, plotting revenge. Therefore any logical flaws in what he says can always just be put down to his tenuous grip on sanity.)",      "FAIR: Uhura claims to be able to speak three dialects of Romulan. It has been established that relations between the Romulans and the Federation have never been friendly and that the only contact was to negotiate a peace. However, there's no reason to presume that their unfriendliness precluded either side learning the other's language somehow. There would be an immense tactical, political, and diplomatic advantage to figuring it out. (It is quite reasonable that, despite the conflict, one side would learn the other's language. In _\"Star Trek\" (1966) {The Enterprise Incident (#3.2)}_ (qv), while Romulan Commander Liliana Charvanek is speaking with Captain Kirk, she remarks, \"Your language has always been most difficult for me, Captain,\" implying that they are not employing the Universal Translator, which must mean that she has studied and mastered English.)",       "FAIR: According to the writers, the new Stardate system has the year and the decimal points indicate the day (i.e. Stardate 2258.42 is February 11, 2258). However, at the beginning of the film, Captain Robau says the Stardate is \"twenty-two thirty-three zero four\". This does not fit into the new system, as he only gives one placeholder zero instead of two or none (it should have been Stardate 2233.4). However, the Stardate system is essentially separating the two numbers. 2233.0000004 would have been correct. But if you want to hold them to a standard, then every Stardate should be four digits, then three, meaning every Stardate in the movie is wrong. This means the Captain was correct.",     "FAIR: SPOILER: By destroying Vulcan, Nero does not prevent the development of red matter. The development of red matter was in his timeline and his timeline remains unchanged.",        "CONT: When Kirk, McCoy and Uhura rush onto the bridge to inform the captain that they are racing into a Romulan trap, Kirk runs towards the captain and Uhura runs to stand right next to Spock. When the camera angle changes, Uhura is not standing next to Spock but about 5 feet to the left of him.",         "CONT: When McCoy and Kirk board a shuttle headed for the Enterprise, there are nacelles visible on the bottom of the hull. However, when it pulls out to reveal the Enterprise in orbit, the nacelles are on the top of the hull.",       "FAIR: In the fight on the drill's platform, which is at an extremely high altitude, Kirk and Sulu remove their helmets. On Earth, humans would find it very difficult to breathe at that height without supplemental oxygen; in Trek mythology, Vulcan's atmosphere is thinner than Earth's. It was an acceptable practice, when visiting or residing on Vulcan, to receive an injection of a Tri-ox compound to assist in breathing (_\"Star Trek\" (1966) {Amok Time (#2.1)}_ (qv)). Knowing that they would be fighting on Vulcan at a high altitude, it seems logical that the away team would be given a similar injection (considering McCoy's penchant for injecting Kirk on the fly), though it was not shown on screen.",      "FAIR: When Kirk convinces Pike and Spock that they are heading into a trap as they warp towards Vulcan, Kirk refers to '47 Klingon Warbirds destroyed by Romulans.' Though \"Warbirds\" are usually Romulan vessels within the _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) canon, the same name has been used for Klingon vessels even in the original timeline, e.g. in _Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)_ (qv).",      "FAIR: The deep crevasse that the young James Kirk dumps the corvette into is not a natural canyon (which are not generally found in Iowa) but a rock quarry.",   "CHAR: When Captain Pike is talking to Kirk in the bar, he says \"You understand what the Federation is, don't you? It's important. It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada.\" However, here he is describing Starfleet and not the Federation. The Federation is an interplanetary government like the United States (a Federal form of government), while Starfleet is the \"peacekeeping and humanitarian\" force.",  "CONT: The Starfleet logo, the distinctive \"arrow-head\" that featured on all the teasers, was originally intended by the production designers of the original _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) series to be the \"assignment patch\" for crew on the Enterprise only. This was reflected on-screen by the use of different patches for different ships or posts. The use of the arrowhead insignia on the Kelvin, before Nero arrives in the past, is therefore a continuity error since history had not yet been altered.",     "FAIR: During Chekov's announcement to the crew during the voyage to Vulcan, he leans over to his left (towards Sulu) when talking about the \"lightning storm in space.\" When Kirk replays the footage of this, Chekov shifts and leans slightly to his right (what would be away from Sulu, if from the viewpoint of the view screen) during this line. The replay of Chekov is reversed, as shown by the location of Captain Pike's knee behind Chekov. In the live version, Pike's knee is correctly on the audience's right. In the replay, Pike's black pant leg is seen on the left. Thus the replay of the video is correct.",         "FACT: Saturn's moon Titan orbits in the plane of the rings, but when the Enterprise rises out of the atmosphere of Titan, the view looks down on the rings.",    "CREW: When Ayel lifts Kirk by the throat you can see wires pulling Kirk up.",   "FAKE: Characters are seen taking the turbo-lift DOWN to the engineering deck of the USS Kelvin. However the exterior shots clearly show the engineering hull is ABOVE the saucer section, where the bridge etc. is located.",    "CHAR: SPOILER: Kirk's statement to the crew that Spock had resigned his commission was incorrect. He was not giving up his rank of Commander, he was stepping down as Captain of the ship. At the end when he is talking to Spock Prime about leaving Starfleet, then he would have resigned his commission.",     "CONT: During the space jump, Chekov reports the away team's altitude every few seconds. His first report gives an altitude of about 20,000 meters, however, the head-up display in front of him shows an altitude of over 100,000 meters. The away team's descent could not possibly have covered about 80,000 meters in such a short period of time. Later reports in the scene show the altitude to be more accurate.",   "CREW: SPOILER: The shadow of the camera is visible on Spock Prime's back near the end of the movie.",    "CONT: SPOILER: When Spock enters the Bridge to become Kirk's first officer in the final scene (after Kirk relieves Pike), he steps off the Turbolift and steps behind a glossy panel. The panel reflects the face of one of the bridge crew: a woman whose red hair is bound up in a weird bun-like do. In the reflection her shirt is red. When the camera switches to the full bridge view, she is wearing blue.",        "CONT: When the Narada first attacks the Enterprise upon its arrival at Vulcan, its missiles impact the Enterprise on the Port (left) side of the \"neck\" connecting the Primary (saucer) and Secondary (Engineering) hulls. However, when Kirk is ejected onto Delta Vega from an airlock in the same general area where the missile impact occurred, there is no sign of any battle damage.",     "CONT: After the Narada comes through the black hole the next shot shows the bridge of the Kelvin and the red alert klaxon is playing. Next, the helmsman says \"I have a reading, they've locked weapons on us.\" The captain then announces red alert even though the klaxon is already playing.",       "CONT: SPOILER: When Spock is beamed away from Spock Prime's ship at the end of the movie he is in a sitting position, but when he materializes on the transporter pad he is in a standing position.",     "CONT: SPOILER: In the end when Spock and Spock Prime are talking, their positions relative to the ships in the hangar change several times between shots.",      "PLOT: When Kirk and crew are devising their plan, Spock says he can board the Narada and \"steal back\" the black hole device. At this time, only Kirk knew that the device was in fact stolen.",        "FAKE: When Kirk and Spock beam aboard the Romulan vessel Spock leans down to perform a mind meld on one of the fallen Romulans. You can clearly see Spock's right hand with a deep scratch revealing RED blood as opposed to green.",     "CONT: During the countdown at the beginning of the movie when Captain Kirk is on the collision course, as it counts down from 18 seconds, it actually takes longer for it to impact than 18 seconds.",    "CONT: In the opening scene, when Captain Robau of the Kelvin says \"Polarize the view screen\" you can see he is wearing a Starfleet badge. As he turns and sits down in the captains chair, it has disappeared, but returns again in the next scene.",   "CONT: When Chekov is briefing the crew on his plan to catch up to the Narada, there is a close-up shot of Bones turned to his left listening with Sulu standing off to his left side. The next shot of everybody standing around shows Bones angled more to the right and Sulu is behind him.",   "CONT: In the fight scene between Nero and Kirk, Nero's injured ear and scars change sides from right to left. In the next scene involving Nero, it is corrected.",       "CONT: When Kirk and Bones are exchanging introductions on the shuttle the day Kirk enlists in Starfleet, the position of Kirk's shoulder belts changes between shots.",   "SYNC: During Spock and Kirk's fight on the bridge, Spock slams Kirk into one of the bridge consoles, which makes a cracking sound like it had been broken by Kirk's impact. When the console is shown again, there is no damage.",       "CONT: When the USS Kelvin is attacked by the Narada, the front half of the saucer section suffers a lot of damage. However, when Ayel appears on the viewscreen after the attack, there is no damage or debris to the saucer section as seen through the windows of the bridge.",  "FAIR: When Uhura walks in on Kirk and Gaila, she says, \"I've been working on solar systems.\" While we refer to our own star system as \"The Solar System\", it is not in the least bit incorrect to refer to any other star system as \"a solar system\". The difference is in the use of \"The\" as opposed to \"A\". A \"solar system\" is simply a planetary system that orbits a star and so Uhura is quite correct in her wording.",         "FAIR: The female Vulcan Minister is smiling as she stands up at Spock's entrance hearing for the Science Academy. However, this is not necessarily an emotional response - smiling can be used to convey approval of a situation (as well as dozens of other meanings), therefore the minister may simply be smiling to signify support of Spock.", "CONT: When Captain Robau is shown at the beginning of the film, the Starfleet insignia on his uniform disappears and reappears again as Robau enters the bridge and sits in his chair. It also happens again when the Narada emerges and attacks the Kelvin.",    "FAKE: Green-skinned Gaila has a white scalp where her hair is parted.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: When Spock Prime is contacted by Nero following the destruction of Romulus, Nero's appearance is not the appearance of a normal Romulan from that timeline. Instead Nero already has the facial tattoos and shaved head consistent with the Romulan mourning ritual, although Nero and his crew should not have performed this ritual until after the attack on the Kelvin - in which the Romulan appearance should also be original time-line appearance. This is often thought to be a mistake, but the events that take place in the original timeline circa 2387 that are described in Spock Prime's mind meld take place over the course of several months and are told out of order in the mind meld - an effort by the filmmakers to simply the exposition for a general audience. This effort to simply the exposition leads these type of confusions. Romulus was actually destroyed while Spock Prime was on Vulcan trying to convince the Vulcan government of the threat and that his plan to collapse the super nova with Red Matter would work (and that the whole supernova thing wasn't part of a Romulan/Federation Cold War ploy). After Romulus was destroyed, the Jellyfish ship and the plan was set in motion. The collapse of the supernova happened weeks after the destruction of Romulus (during which time Nero and his crew got the mourning tattoos, had his ship refitted to become the monster ship with the Borg technology that is seen in the film, battled 24th century Starfleet and Klingon fleets, etc.). Another thing that is unclear in the film is that after collapsing the supernova, Ambassador Spock created a second smaller black hole that he modified into a temporal vortex through which he intended to travel to go back in time a few months and collapse the Hobus star before it ever went nova and thus save Romulus; however, before his small ship was pulled into the temporal vortex by its gravity, Nero arrived and his ship being of larger mass was pulled in first. Nero's ship not having been a part of Ambassador Spock's calculations completely comprised the intended effect and Nero traveled back in time 154 years and Ambassador Spock ended up traveling back 129 years (into the altered time-line).",       "FAIR: There are no mountain ranges anywhere in Iowa, yet one appears clearly visible behind Kirk while approaches the Starfleet base to join up.  However, on the DVD/Blu-ray's additional content, the filmmakers are actually aware of this, and joke about \"the geography in the future\" being different.",   "CHAR: When Spock requests permission to come on the bridge, he says, \"Permission to come aboard, Captain.\" He is in fact already on board the Enterprise. Protocol requires that he should have requested permission to be allowed on the command bridge, as he is not a command officer nor bridge personnel at that moment.",  "FAIR: When Chekov beams Kirk and Sulu onto the transporter pad from their free-fall, they hit the pad hard enough to send (badly animated) shards from the pad into the air, as well as cracking noises. However, when the pad is shown again, there is no damage whatsoever. The shards from the pad are actually the transporter beams \"breaking\" apart as they hit the floor. While there is a distinct breaking sound, one can assume that this is the noise of the beams as this hasn't happened before nor has it happened again (yet).",    "CONT: In the first scene with Mr. Scott at his desk in the outpost, the x-ray machine as seen over his left shoulder is pointing forward, yet moments later when he stands up, it is pointing to the right.",     "CONT: SPOILER: When Kirk helps Pike off the torture table on the Narada, he supports Pike on his left side. But when they're beamed aboard Enterprise, Pike is standing on Kirk's right.",       "FAIR: The movie's universe diverges from the familiar _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) universe in 2233, when Nero arrived in the past, many details of character behavior, technology, terminology, alien culture, etc., were changed.",      "CONT: The USS Kelvin's upper engineering hull has a tapered cylindrical shape in all but one shot. It is clearly spherical in the shot of Captain Robau's shuttle leaving the shuttle bay.",      "CONT: In the opening battle sequence, the computer indicates that weapons are offline but when the crew person gets sucked out through a hull breach soon after, they bang into a firing phaser bank.",  "CONT: Uhura's earrings change color several times throughout the mission. It is highly unlikely that she finds time to change in the midst of an imminent threat to the ship and the Earth.",     "FACT: 1548 squared is 2396304. Not 2396324 as stated in the beginning of the movie.",   "CONT: SPOILER: When Spock and his father Sarek are discussing his mother Amanda's death in the transporter room, one side of the doorway designates the pad as M-1660 while the other side reads M-1330.",       "SYNC: When young Kirk is driving his step father's Corvette and listening to him on the cell phone, you can hear the sound of gears being shifted but his hands never leave the steering wheel.

He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife who is in labor while delivering their son James Tiberius Kirk in the hospital shuttlecraft, George Kirk crashes the Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk grows up and when he meets Captain Christopher Pike in a bar fight, he is invited to join Starfleet. Meanwhile in Vulcan, the outcast Spock grows-up discriminated against for his half-human condition. They meet each other in Starfleet Academy, wherein Spock accuses Kirk of lack of ethics, cheating a test of command. The trial is suspended with the information that Vulcan is under attack, sending Federation starships to Vulcan, including the recently commissioned USS Enterprise. Kirk, who is a stowaway, foresees an alien attack and advises Captain Pike; however, the Enterprise is damaged and when Captain Pike travels to meet Captain Nero, Spock has command and a serious friction with Kirk after the destruction of Vulcan. Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded on the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by old Spock who explains to Kirk that Captain Nero blames Spock and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova. Spock explains that he had failed in the creation of a black hole with red matter to consume the supernova and Nero is seeking revenge.

The policeman is clearly seen smiling just before he starts to flee from the Terminator.",        "CHAR: When Det. Vukovich laughs at Dr. Silberman's ray gun joke, he can be seen reacting to an off-screen crew member who must be gesturing for him to stop looking at Sarah Connor and back to the video monitor.",      "CHAR: When the Terminator tosses the bearded man away from the phone booth and begins searching the phone book for Sarah Conner, he uses his finger sliding down the page to assist separating the lines of type, the way human beings do when they read.

There wasn't enough time for her to move.",   "FAKE: When the Terminator is done operating on his own eye, he has a robotic eye. As soon as he puts his sunglasses on, Arnolds eyes are back to normal and clearly visible through the glasses from that moment on.",   "FACT: During Reese and Sarah's car swap from the Ford LTD to the Eldorado, Reese hits the ignition with the butt of his shotgun and the ignition tumbler suddenly loosens. This is impossible. Reese would have only knocked the chrome fob off.

The sound for a 35mm film is read by a head located about a foot past the projection lamp; so, for the film and sound to remain in perfect sync, the soundtrack for a given frame is located about a foot in front of that frame, that way the image and the sound are projected simultaneously. For the sound and image flashes to occur at the same precise moment, Tyler would thus have to splice the frame of audio onto the reel about a foot further along than he splices the image frame, which he doesn't do (not to mention, it would be impossible to perfectly sync it by hand anyway). However anything we see Tyler doing must be taken with a pinch of salt, since he is just a part of the Narrators imagination.

Tyler and Maria develop a relationship leaving him often on the outside of what is going on. He soon finds that the group is out of control and after a major self-revelation decides there is only one way out. A young urban professional who works for a major car manufacturer can't sleep. Although he doesn't have any of the associated afflictions, he stumbles across support groups as a means to let out whatever emotions he is feeling, which in turn is allowing him to sleep. But the use of these support groups is ruined when he meets a young woman named Marla Singer, who is also going to all these support group meetings. Because he knows she too is not afflicted with any of the maladies for which the groups exist, her presence has lessened the impact of the stories he hears. His life changes when he meets a soap manufacturer named Tyler Durden, who in many ways is the antithesis of the insomniac. Due to unusual circumstances with his own condo, the insomniac moves in with Tyler, who lives in a large dilapidated house in an otherwise abandoned part of town. After a bit of spontaneous roughhousing with Tyler in a bar parking lot, the insomniac finds it becomes a ritual between the two of them, which is helping him cope with the other more difficult aspects of his life. The fights also attract a following, others who not only want to watch but join in. Understanding that there are other men like them, the insomniac and Tyler begin a secret fight club. As the fight club's popularity grows, so does its scope in all aspects. Marla becomes a circle not specifically of the fight clubs but of Tyler and the insomniac's collectives lives. As the nature of the fight clubs becomes out of control in the insomniac's view, the insomniac's life, in association, is one where he no longer understands what is happening around him, or how he can get out of it without harming himself.",  "by" : "Huggo" } ], "taglines" : [      "How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?",         "When you wake up in a different place at a different time, can you wake up as a different person?",      "Losing all hope is freedom",   "Mischief.
