She then keeps moving towards it while singing in closeup (which would have taken her right up to the edge). She then runs forwards in a wide shot, but instead of falling off the edge she should be right next to, she runs up over a hill that appears from nowhere, before she creates the steps to bridge the gap.",       "CONT: In the shot where Anna and Kristoff gets a first glimpse of Elsa's castle, the camera starts from behind an exposed rock protrusion, but in the shot of the mountain before the song \"Let it Go\" starts there was none.",      "FACT: After Anna and Kristoff fall off the cliff, when he pops his upper body out of the snow, there's no displaced snow from his landing.",   "PLOT: When Elsa creates a snowstorm in her palace it's centered around her, but when she does it in the castle it isn't, as she is walking against the wind.",         "FACT: When Kristof falls into the snow after being thrown off by Marshmallow, the snow is perfectly flat on top of him with no dent nor impact marks.",        "CONT: When Olaf meats Elsa for the first time it is clear that not only is she surprised to see him, she has now idea how she made him.

The following changes were made to the film for this release:  The \"In Association with Silver Screen Partners IV\" credit is replaced with \"The Special Edition Of--\" on the opening title sequence. The 2002 DVD omits this credit & the Walt Disney Pictures Presents credit stays on screen.  The animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large IMAX screen. Small details, such as the blood in Beast's wound after his fight with the wolves, were also added.  The Beast's \"stutter\" (\"You wan-wanna stay in the tower?\"), a sound editing mistake, was corrected (\"You wanna stay in the tower?\").  Six minutes of new footage was added between the songs \"Something There\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" most of which is made up of a new musical sequence, \"Human Again.\" This song was written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for the original version of the film, but cut for continuity purposes. After Alan Menken altered the song to make it work for the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the song was worked back into the film.  During the \"Human Again\" song sequence, the household objects clean up the Beast's castle, which necessitated having the background artists go back and digitally re-paint the backgrounds for the castle scenes that followed so that the castle was clean.  The animation for Cogsworth's line to the Beast after Belle is freed (\"Yes-yes-yes, but...why?\") was completely re-done, as the directors never liked how the animation looked in the original version.  New sound effects are added to the shot where Belle and Phillippe leave the castle to find Maurice, which are supposed to suggest that the Beast trashes his room in anguish (and also so that the backgrounds from this point on would not have to be repainted).  The longer credits necessitated the addition of an additional passage of score music, the version of the 'Transformation' theme that was cut out of the original film, to the end of the film.",  "In the 3D re-release the old Disney logo is replaced with the new Disney logo(with either Walt Disney Pictures text or just Disney text depending on source) and the Walt Disney Animation Studios logo is added in. These changes were also made in the 2010 Diamond Edition Blu-ray and DVD releases",       "The \"original theatrical version\" blu-ray features the following alterations: After the \"Something There\" sequence, the background has been changed from Belle and Beast in front of the fireplace to an empty hallway (as seen in the Special Edition.) A bit of the character animation has also been altered in this shot. During the \"Beauty and the Beast\" ballroom sequence, a reflection of Belle has been added to the window.",         "In the closing credits of the 3D version, instead of a black background, they added in rough animation 3D silhouette drawings of all of the characters.",      "A \"work-in-progress\" edition has also been released on a CAV laserdisc in 1992. This is the unfinished preview version shown at the New York Film Festival in September 1991, with 80% of its animation complete, the remaining footage represented by sketches, drawings and painted storyboards.  It runs the same length as the final cut and has no new scenes but includes a alternate version of \"Be Our Guest\" sung to Belle's father after he stumbles into the castle.  It was decided to make \"Be Our Guest\" more of a show stopper and place it in the middle of the film to be sung to Belle. The alternate scene is all in penciltest.",    "On the soundtrack and possibly preview/test screenings, there is a scene during the \"Gaston\" song in which Lefou tries to spell Gaston's name and then gives up. This scene is not in the video version. Only some copies of the soundtrack have the full length music of \"West Wing\", which is the energetic instrumental music heard when the Beast saves Belle from the wolves. What versions (CD or cassette, retail or music club) have which, and why it was trimmed, is a tough question, but the long version is 4:22 and the short one is 3:39. (The short version is cut right where Belle is running out of the castle before the attack.) The CD box set \"The Music Behind The Magic\", which features The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin music, is also completely void of the full track, containing only a 2:19-long version.",         "A different version of the \"work in progress\" edition, mentioned above, was released on VHS in a special box set. It features all the scenes from the final movie but doesn't include the alternate version of \"Be Our Guest.\" The tape does include a making-of documentary and a short sequence illustrating step-by-step how the film was animated. This is the \"Work-In-Progress\" that is availiable on the DVD.",   "When the movie was released on DVD in October 2002, it offered three versions of the film: the \"Special Edition\" (the IMAX cut), the \"Work-In-Progress\" version (with Belle in the Be Our Guest;\" the original work-in-progress cut featured Maurice in this sequence), and an \"Original Theatrical Version.\" The \"Original Theatrical Version.\" is actually identical to the IMAX/ \"Special Edition\" version, except that it retains the original animation of the footage from the end of \"Something There\" until Belle's release from the castle (this includes the retention of Cogsworth's original animation in his conversation with the Beast after Belle is freed) and the original end credits sequence.

Perhaps the biggest error of all is the fact that none of the villagers seem to have seen or heard of this \"hidden\" kingdom, which sits deep in the nearby forest.",       "CONT: At the beginning of the movie before Belle starts singing, you can see the steps go down and lead to a path heading to the village. Although when Gaston comes to purpose to her, the steps go down to a path to the barn. Later when Gaston and other villagers come to take Maurice to the asylum it faces straight to the village.",  "CONT: In the song \"Gaston\" when Gaston sings \"when I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs, every morning to help me get large\" he grabs the eggs and swallows them whole. Lafou attempts the same to only have them fall on his face. After he says \"so I'm roughly the size of a barge!\" and shoots his gun a bowl of eggs appears on the counter.",         "FACT: In the opening introduction before the song \"Belle\" we see Belle's house. The windmill on the house has two gears that are clearly working against one another, yet they still turn perfectly.",       "DATE: The band plays the \"Bridal Chorus\" (better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\" to most people) composed by Richard Wagner. Wagner composed it sometime in the mid 19th century. The movie takes place sometime around the mid 18th century. The \"Bridal Chorus\" was not played in places other than Germany until the late 19th century or early 20th century.",       "CONT: When the Beast is transformed back into a prince, his right sleeve has a big hole in it. But, it disappeared for a few seconds and appeared later when the castle is transformed back.",         "CONT: The three blonde girls who love Gaston have three distinct hairstyles in the song \"Belle\" and during the song \"Gaston\". They have identical hairstyles in the pull-out shot at the end of the \"Gaston\" number in the pub.",        "CONT: In the scene where Gaston and LeFou are plotting with the asylum keeper, Gaston elbows LeFou and the mug of beer that Lafou is drinking gets stuck on his face. When LeFou finally gets the mug off, beer splashes around in the cup indicating that the mug is at least half full. However, Lafou turns the mug over on his head to block another blow from Gaston seconds later and the mug is now empty.",    "FAIR: When Belle is at the village fountain with the sheep, she points to a picture in her book. Moments later, after the song \"Belle\" ends, Gaston takes the book and asks how she can read a book with no pictures. However, Gaston does not look through the whole book but only a couple of pages.",     "SYNC: At the end of the \"Gaston\" number, women's voices can be heard. But the only women visible are Gaston's three suitors, and their faces are frozen in huge smiles showing off their teeth, so there is no way they can be singing these parts.",        "DATE: During a reference to France in the \"Be Our Guest\" number, a vision of the Eiffel Tower is formed, which didn't exist yet.",   "CONT: In the scene where the Beast is overlooking Belle from the balcony, you see in the far shot that her dress is blue. However, in the close up shot, her dress is obviously green.",       "SYNC: When the Beast is fighting off the wolves, there are multiple times when the sound of ripping cloth is heard, implying that the wolves were tearing the Beast's cape. However, once the fight is over and the Beast is seen alone with Belle, there's no damage to his cape at all.",    "CONT: In Belle's room, the design of the door's appearance on the inside of Belle's room changes in the shot when she opens it up for Mrs. Potts.",    "CONT: During the fighting sequence with Gaston, the Beast's pants get ripped. When the Beast is transformed back into a prince, there is a close-up shot of his foot as it changes. During this moment, his pants are not torn. They go back to being torn when his pants are next seen.",     "CONT: When Maurice is leaving to rescue Belle, a large map gets stuck in the door when he closes it. Two shots later, the map is visible from the inside, but when Gaston kicks the door open, the other side of the map is no longer there as it should be.",        "CONT: Immediately after the ballroom dance scene, Belle and the Beast sit on a balcony and Belle says to the Beast \"If only I could see my father again, just for a moment. I miss him so much.\" and the camera changes to a close up of the Beast. In this close up the Beast's right horn visibly slides around on his head for a moment before snapping into place.",      "CONT: The scratch marks that the Beast makes in his portrait change direction and location throughout the film.",      "CONT: During the final battle, when Cogsworth comes to rescue Lumiere from LeFou, he is holding a gun, but two shots later, right before he slides down the banister, the gun disappears.",    "CONT: As Maurice leaves the house to rescue Belle, he stuffs a pair of long underwear into his pack. The pair falls out and gets caught in the door when Maurice shuts it. Two shots later, when Gaston and LeFou barge in, the underwear is gone.",   "CONT: When Belle is bringing her father in the house after finding him in the woods, Phillipe (the horse) is clearly seen eating a mouthful of grass. Since context clues tell us it is winter, all the grass would be dead and unappetizing to a horse.",     "CONT: When Chip's reflection can be seen in the floor, his mouth is not visible as it should be.",     "CONT: After the Beast rescues Belle from the wolves and is brought back to the castle, Belle is trying to mend the Beast's arm. In the shots where she is attempting to place the cloth on his arm and when they start arguing, there are clearly three scratches on his arm, but when it zooms to a closer shot when the Beast has settled down a bit, there are four scratches.",    "CONT: During \"The Mob Song\", when Gaston begins singing to LeFou, the mirror cannot be seen, but during that same section, Gaston clearly pulls the mirror out of his belt.",       "GEOG: In the \"Belle\" number, LeFou can be seen carrying a bundle of pelts, one of which has the gray and black ringed tail of a raccoon. But the film is set in France, and raccoons are indigenous to North America.",       "CONT: When Gaston is trying to kiss Belle in her house, she opens the door and he falls out into the mud. This would mean the door opens outwards. In the next scene when Belle sets his boots outside (and in all later scenes), the door opens inwards.",    "CONT: When Beast first brings Belle to her room, her bed has a rose in the center at the foot of it. In a later scene when Mrs. Potts meets Belle for the first time and bringing tea, the rose in the bed is gone.",  "FACT: There are several references to Belle and Maurice being locked in the dungeon but as the Beast correctly states, they were held in the tower. A dungeon would be underground such as a basement. Belle had to climb several flights of steps to get to her father in the tower.",        "CONT: During the opening song when Belle is on her way to the bookshop, the book that she is carrying changes from red, to blue in her basket, to red again. The basket also disappears and reappears at different points in the song.",       "CONT: In the middle of the song \"Belle\" we see a bird being shot with an arrow and falling to the ground. Lefou picks it up, taking it back to Gaston who is seen holding, not a bow, but a smoking musket which is implied to be what he used to shoot the bird with by Lefou.",    "CONT: When Belle talk to the Baker on her way to the bookshop, the binding on the book she shows him switches sides.",         "DATE: SPOILER: During the final dance with Belle and Adam dancing in the ballroom, the bystanders on the outskirts of the dance floor are dressed in medieval clothing and are drawn in a distinctly different style from the characters in the movie (except for the inserted servant staff). This is because the film re-used crowd cells from Sleeping Beauty (set in the Middle Ages) in this scene. As such, there are several centuries of difference between the characters of the film and the crowd surrounding them at the end.",    "DATE: During the \"Human Again\" number, Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth are in a parody of Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\" painting, which didn't exist until 1930.",       "FACT: When Cogsworth is showing Belle around the castle for the first time, he asks her to draw her attention to the flying buttresses above.

It has been claimed this was due to a bureaucratic error, but the real reason for this action was because the international companies were unhappy with the scripts on the earlier releases and wanted to be more faithful to the original dialogue. Many international fans disliked the new dubs, especially in Germany, where several petitions were set up to restore the old dub on DVD (which actually resulted in Disney including the old dub on the 2013 DVD/Blu-ray release). Other countries affected by the change were France, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Poland, Turkey, Israel, Thailand and Japan.",     "For the re-release in 1997-1998, the end credits were changed to reflect the use of newer sound formats (Dolby Digital, DTS and SDDS). They also have altered music: a shorter version of \"Under the Sea\" and then \"Part of Your World\" as sung by Ariel. The dissolve to the first scene with Scuttle is also different, with an abrupt end.",    "In the Swedish VHS release, a few scenes have been cut. They include most of the song that Louis sings when he chops the fish (only the part when he discovers Sebastian is still in the film), some shots of Triton destroying Ariel's cavern, and some scenes between where Ursula says (towards the end) \"Now I am the ruler of all the ocean. The waves obey my every whim\" and where she is killed by Eric. This makes the Swedish dubbing on the DVD version a little odd, since these scenes are then in English. These problems has since been corrected for the newer Special Edition DVD, but the changes made to the dubbing are still noticeable to the trained ear.",   "A 2-disc Platinum Edition was released on DVD in October 2006. There are a handful of changes, as well as some things that only appear to be changed.  The most noteworthy change is that the infamous priest's knee has been smoothed out the first time it is seen. (For those who prefer accuracy, poke around disc 2 a little bit and see if you find some consolation.)  A few goofs have been corrected: the \"bubble curtain\" before \"Daughters of  Triton\" is smoother and Grimsby's hand as Ariel and Eric begin their day out  has been covered by Carlotta. On the other hand, Ariel's sisters' clamshells  for their song are miscolored a seafoam green instead of light blue.  When the credits start crawling, they are sped up a little bit to accommodate several restoration credits near the end. The total credits time is unchanged.  The original Dolby Stereo logo has been replaced (as in the 1997-8 re-release) with newer sound specifications (SDDS, Dolby Digital, DTS) in the credits.  At the end of the credits, \"cassette and compact disc from\" no longer follows \"soundtrack available on\"; as well, as with the re-release, a new Walt Disney Records logo is used. What has not changed:  The original movie has some computer-generated elements (such as the ship and a staircase Ariel runs down); these are not new, and have been in the movie from its first release.  While the re-release used a shorter version of \"Under the Sea\" in the credits, followed by Ariel singing \"Part of Your World,\" the original version (and the 2006 DVD) feature a slightly longer \"Under the Sea\" and a wordless choral arrangement of \"Part of Your World,\" so the audio for the credits is faithful to the original.",       "When the film was released on VHS in Norway, these three scenes were cut short: first, part of the shark chase; second, when Eric sees the dynamite, followed by the explosion; and third, when Ursula tries to shoot Ariel off the rock and then tries to kill her. The DVD has these scenes intact, however.",       "In October 2013 the Diamond Edition Blu-ray (and DVD) matching the newest restoration and 3D conversion was released, with a few steps forward and a few steps back. The picture quality is appropriately filmic (as the last Disney movie to be hand-colored), though the original Dolby Stereo sound mix is still absent. Specifics:  The original Walt Disney Pictures logo (blue with white castle and text) has been replaced at the start and end of the movie by the long CGI castle logo (reading only \"Disney\").  The opening credits have been re-typeset in a heavier font and re-timed (starting much earlier for example), and the Silver Screen Partners IV credit (originally after the movie title) is missing.  Two shots near the end of \"Part of Your World\" have been swapped: Ariel should sink before the reaction shot of Flounder, but now they happen in the wrong order, and introduce a lip-sync error. Disney is aware of the mistake but does not judge it important enough to correct.  The opening scene fades in a few seconds earlier than any other version.  The dissolve from \"you really are a guppy\" to Scuttle's first scene is replaced with a straight cut, possibly erroneously.  The bubble curtain stutter fix and censorship of the priest's knee remain.  The end credits now contain additional information for the 3D process, etc. The overall length and audio content generally seems the same as the original.  A few previous changes from the 2006 DVD have been undone and reflect the film's original look:  Ariel's sisters' clamshells from \"Daughters of Triton\" return to their blue color.  Grimsby's hand when Ariel and Eric start their tour of the kingdom is once again visible in front of Carlotta (this is actually an animation goof, since it should be obscured by her).  It is unclear if this is a goof from 1989 that has remained out of frame on previous transfers or something introduced in 2013, but as Eric and Ariel dive off giant Ursula, when they hit the water a heavy black stripe on the background moves into frame in the top right corner.",      "1998 USA VHS release has credits barn-doored with a music video making most of the credits impossible to read and giving the general impression of a TV showing of the film.",         "The magazine Entertainment Weekly published in an article that the 1990 home video version includes a less-than-a-second background image of the silhouette of a menacing knife hovering over a scared Mickey Mouse.",        "During the re-release in 1998, a new Austrian German-dubbed version was made and shown in Austrian theaters starting in June 1998.

Another dubbed version was made in the Viennese dialect, with 'Jazz Gitti' (qv) as the voice of Ursula, but this version has never been commercially available.",       "On pre-rerelease VHS versions of the film, there is a scene where Ursula (as Vanessa) is marrying Eric (most of this scene is still in newer versions). In one shot you can see the pastor's (Priest's) knee move up and down, which looks convincingly (to some) like an erection.

Next scene shows Woody standing next to the monitor again.",   "CONT: \"Legs\" and \"Ducky\" go into the air vent of Sid's house at the beginning of the rescue, but when they go to the garden they come out the drain pipe which would be attached to the outside of the roof not coming from inside the house anywhere near the air vent.",         "CHAR: When Buzz and Woody are trying to get back into the moving van, Woody opens the boxes of Andy's toys in search of R.C.

One was replaced with lizard-like creature while the other was replaced by a creature with elephant tusks. Both the werewolves and their replacements can seen in footage used in a supplemental DVD packaged with the soundtrack to Episode III",    "These are all the changes made between the 1977, 1997, and 2004 versions:  The scenes where the Stormtroopers are looking through the sand for the  escape pod has extra special effects in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  When the Sandcrawler is climbing over the sand, the angle has changed to  make the machine look much bigger in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  C3PO saying \"We've stopped.\" has been added to the scene where he and R2D2  are in the sand-crawler for the 2004 version.  The binary sunset on Tatooine was made more consistent between shots in the  2004 version.  When Obi-Wan makes a call to scare away the Tusken Raiders, it has been  changed, due to sounding too closely like a dew back scream. In the 2004  version it sounds more like the Boga lizard from Episode III, although it  has always said to be the call of the Krayt Dragon in books and other  sources.  The establishing shot of Obi-Wan Kenobi's home has been expanded with a big  matte painting in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  When Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids overlook Mos Eisley, the 1997 and 2004  versions have a bigger view with more detail.  When the land speeder arrives in Mos Eisley, the 1997 version added extra  effects to make it more real. The 2004 version further enhanced the special  effects with more fluid movement.  Mos Eisley itself has been expanded in the 1997 and 2004 versions with extra  special effects shots, and the strange black blur under the land speeder has  been removed.  In the 1997 version, Greedo shot first during his confrontation with Han  Solo, instead of the other way around. The 2004 version has them shooting  almost at the exact same time.  The 1997 version added a scene of Han talking to a CGI animated Jabba The  Hutt and inserted Boba Fett into the scene as well. The 2004 version  retained this scene but improved the CGI Jabba.  When the Millenium Falcon takes off, extra effects were added into the 1997  and 2004 versions to make it smoother and less static.  In the 2004 version, a line has been added to one of the stormtroopers after  they search the Millenium Falcon to confirm they found nothing.  A larger Alderaan explosion was added in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  C-3PO's line \"The power beam holding the ship is coupled to the main reactor  in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will enable the  ship to leave\" was omitted from the 1981 version, but restored in the 1997  and 2004 versions.  Several laser shots fired in the 1997 and 2004 versions have been censored  to not show the impact.  When one of the stormtroopers bang their head on the door, a sound effect  has been added in the 2004 version.  The cell block corridor has been expanded in the 2004 version.  The Dianogah in the garbage chute has been improved with CGI in the 2004  version, and now blinks.  The writing on the tractor beam has been changed in the 2004 version to  Aurabesh.  When Luke and Leia are running from the stormtroopers and find themselves at  a dead end, there is extra echo effect added into the 2004 version.  When Han runs down the corridor and is confronted by stormtroopers, the 1997  and 2004 versions had a whole room full of them.  When Han and Chewie are running from the stormtroopers, the 1997 and 2004  versions add an extra small line for Han.  The light sabers in the Obi-Wan/Darth Vader fight have been cleaned up in  the 2004 version. The 2004 version also corrects a shot from shortly after  the fight where Darth Vader's light saber had not been colored by the  effects crew. It now appears red as it should be.  In the 1997 and 2004 versions, we actually see the Millenium Falcon when it  is arriving at the rebel base, and the huge doors are moving now instead of  stationary.  There is a small conversation between Luke and his friend Biggs before they  go into battle.  When the Rebels launch to go into attack, the 1997 and 2004 versions have  added more special effects.  A shot of the Rebel fleet in space has been expanded in the 1997 and 2004  versions and the camera now moves with the X-Wings.  The line \"He's ON Your Tail\" was added for the 1997 version but removed  again for the 2004 version.  The Death Star explosion is expanded in the 1997 and 2004 versions.  Many matte lines have been removed throughout the 1997 and 2004 versions and  other similar optical improvements have been made. The overall video and  audio quality has also been improved in each version, sometimes with changes  to some sound effects.",   "The 2006 DVD reissue contains a \"bonus disc\" which features the unaltered, pre-special edition film, with the original opening crawl (without the \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" subtitle) and the 1993 LaserDisc sound mix without C-3PO's \"tractor beam description\" and Stormtrooper \"close the blast doors\" lines. This is the first and only time that this version will be available on video in regular DVD.",     "The film was originally released with two stereo mixes created from the same four-track master. Later, a third audio mix was prepared for theaters which had not upgraded to Dolby stereo yet. This third audio mix was in mono and had a few minor differences from the other two audio mixes such as Aunt Beru being dubbed by a different actress. In 1981, two of the three versions were updated to include the \"A New Hope\" subtitle - the version not updated was the mono mix. Later on, a fifth audio mix was created (the fourth being created for the 1985 VHS release) for the 1993 Definitive Collection Laserdisc set. This audio mix combined elements from all three of the theatrical audio mixes but was primarily sourced from the 70mm stereo mix. The 1997 Special Edition and 2004 DVD release feature more changes (both audio and visual). The 2006 DVD bonus disc is made from the masters for the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set but with the highest quality 1977 print available spliced in for the original opening crawl. This means that (excluding TV edits and pan & scan releases) there have been at least TEN different versions of Star Wars to date.",      "In 1977, \"Ken Films\" released a pair of truncated versions for the 8mm home movie market. One version is in black and white and is silent; an other has color and is silent. The longest color and sound version has 17 minutes running time. There are also two further color and sound versions existing: one with 8 minutes and one with 4 minutes. The English company \"Derran\" released a complete version of STAR WARS on 750 meters polyester Super-8 in Cinemascope & Dolby Stereo (etemated 50 - 100 copies).",         "The German \"marketing film\" released 10 months after the cinema start in West Germany a cut version on Super-8 on two reels in 4:3/color/sound. Reel #1 is running 17 minutes (120 meters), reel #2 is running 9 minutes. This two reels are fitting together and are showing the story from the beginning of the movie to the end of the fight between the Falcon and the TIE fighters right after the escape from the Death Star. The assault on the Death Star didn't make it in this Super-8 version. The beginning shows not the opening crawl, the cut version starts in space over Tatooine with the star destroyer attack on Princess Leias's blockade runner while a speaker summarizes the opening crawl. Almost three years later the German \"UFA\" released a 17 minutes long version including parts of the final battle against the Death Star and the throne room ceremony. Additional this version includes a lot of sequences not shown in the \"marketing film\" version: cantina scenes, Tusken raider scenes, the destruction of Alderaan, the Death Star approach of the Falcon after entering the Alderaan system. By editing this three reels together the viewer got a complete overview of the story. But Obi-Wans death is not shown. The 17 minutes US \"Ken Films\" version (F48) provides two scenes not included in the German version: Vaders conversation on the blockade runner and a part of Luke and Leias swing across the abyss. Editing this two scenes - copying the German audio track - into the \"marketing/UFA\"-3-reel-version provided the longest available cut version of STAR WARS: 43 minutes.",       "In the 2004 DVD edition, Vader's lines are lowered very slightly in pitch so his voice sounds more like it does in the next two films.",         "When the original theatrical version was first released, it was simply titled Star Wars.The opening crawl was changed to \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" during the 1981 re-release. According to Sterling Hedgpeth, Lucasfilm film archivist: \"I found a box with all the positive elements for the 'revised' opening crawl, and the assorted trim boxes are dated from October through December 1980. This, then, is consistent with the view that Episode IV: A New Hope was added for the first time to the opening crawl for the April 10, 1981 re-release.\"",  "Stills from the \"lost\" Tatooine scenes have been published (in \"The Star Wars Storybook\", for example) and at least one sequence is shown in the documentary 'The Making of 'Star Wars'\".  Also, the scenes were included in the novel, comic book and radio adaptations of the story.",     "David West Reynolds, an employee with Industrial Light and Magic discovered a forgotten black-and-white workprint of Star Wars which was edited before the addition of special effects, and contained a large number of differences. This lost cut includes more long panning shots of the desert and a new scene in Mos Eisley where a small alien runs and hides from a large Alien in an alleyway; the aforementioned Cantina scene is also from this edit. All the landspeeder, Millennium Falcon, and cockpit shots were done with real time projections of special effects. They were deemed inferior to the blue screen tests, so they were discarded. The running time of this rough edit was 2 hours and 30 minutes.",         "There are a few noticeable differences between the version shown on ITV on British television during the 1980s and early, pre-'remastered' video releases:  The sound quality of the voices heard over intercoms and radios during the  Battle of Yavin is very different.  On TV, Luke says \"Blast it, Wedge, where are you?\"  On the video he says,  \"Blast it, Biggs, where are you?\"  On TV, Porkins' final dying scream is drowned out.  On TV, a stormtrooper searching for the droids on Tatooine says, \"This one's  secure, move onto the next one\".  On the video he says 'locked' instead of  secure.",       "The 1981 re-issue contains three dialogue differences from the original. First is the appearance of the \"close the blast doors\" line that was silenced in the 1981 version.  The 1977 version has Aunt Beru's line \"All his friends have gone\" places emphasis on \"friends\" rather than \"gone\" in the 1981 version. Finally, Luke shouts \"Blast it, Wedge, where are you?\" rather than \"Blast it, Biggs, where are you?\" Because Luke's head is turned to the side, it's impossible to tell which is the on-set name used. The redubbing makes Wedge's rescue of Luke more unexpected.",   "The subtitles for the Han and Jabba scene have been altered slightly for the DVD. Originally, the phrases \"twenty percent\" and \"fifteen percent\" are spelled out. In the DVD, they are abbreviated as \"20%\" and \"15%,\" to save space, since the typeface used for the captions is larger than that used in the theatrical version.",       "The voice of the actress who played Aunt Beru, 'Shelagh Fraser' (qv), was dubbed over in all but the original prints.",         "In the video version of the original, when the stormtroopers are chasing Han down the hall, you can hear one of them say \"Open the blast door. Open the blast door\" as Han and Chewbacca pass through it and leave the troopers on the other side. In the special edition, you can hear one of the stormtroopers say \"Close the blast door\" before it closes. The scene is actually a little funnier because it's his own fault that the door closed. The extra dialogue was \"lost\" on the home video release but the line did exists in earlier theatrical versions, as evidenced by the 1977 audio recording of the film entitled \"The Story of Star Wars.\" This LP/audio cassette includes that line, in the exact same voice and reading as it appears in the special edition. Also note that foreign language versions of the film did have the translation of that line. The \"close the blast doors\" line is also seen in a Star Wars clip in the 1993 special \"George Lucas: Heroes, Myth and Magic\" on the PBS series _\"American Masters\" (1983)_.",  "The \"lost scenes\" from this film, namely Luke's discovering the orbital Tantive-IV-Battle while working on a moisture vaporator; Luke storming into Station Tosche at Anchorhead to tell his friends, Fixer, Camie, and Biggs about the space battle he witnessed; and Luke's and Biggs' extended talk about Biggs' having been assigned to work on the starship Rand Ecliptic, and also confiding in Luke that he has made certain friends at the Imperial Academy who plan to join the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine reveal that one of Luke's friends, Camie, was played by 'Koo Stark' (qv) (of early Eighties 'Prince Andrew' (qv) liaison fame). Sadly the scenes never made it into the movie and can only be seen on the \"Behind the Magic\" CD-ROM-discs.",    "In all theatrical versions, subtitles for alien languages appear at the bottom of the frame. In widescreen video releases, the subtitles are moved to the top of the lower black bar, so that they actually appear below the image without obstructing the picture. Long lines of dialogue, such as those during the Greedo scene, were originally given one long caption at the bottom of the screen. Due to the shorter space available on television screens, these captions were broken into two pieces. \"Jabba put a price on your head so big every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you\" was split into \"Jabba put a price so big on your head...\" followed by, \"every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.\"",       "The 2004 DVD also features substantial changes in the sound mix, especially in regards to the music.

This is after Porkins, who was Red 6, has been destroyed. But there is a hectic space battle going on with tons of Rebel and Imperial ships - and as a result, tons of radio calls.

In a distant galaxy eons before the creation of the mythical planet known as Earth, vast civilizations have evolved, and ruling the galaxy is an interstellar Empire created from the ruins of an Old Republic that held sway for generations. It is a time of civil war, as solar systems have broken away from the Empire and are waging a war of rebellion. During a recent battle, technical schematics for a gigantic space station, code named the Death Star, have been unearthed by Rebel spies, and a young woman who is a dissident member of the Imperial Senate, under the cover of a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, is trying to smuggle these plans to the Rebellion. But her spacecraft is attacked by a vast warship of the Empire and seized. The dissident Senator is captured, but the plans for the Death Star are nowhere to be found. While soldiers of the Empire search the nearby planet Tatooine, a series of incidents sweeps up a young desert farmer with dreams of being a fighter pilot in the Rebellion, as he winds up with the Death Star plans and also the assistance of an elderly hermit who once served as a warrior of an ancient order whose chosen weapons were powerful energy swords known as lightsabers. The pair recruit a cynical interstellar smuggler and his outsized alien copilot with an ancient freighter heavily modified for combat to help them reach Alderaan - but the planet is obliterated and now the foursome must rescue the young woman held prisoner by the Empire and lead an attack by the Rebellion against the Death Star before it can annihilate all hope of restoring freedom to the galaxy.",    "by" : "Michael Daly" } ], "taglines" : [        "It's Back!

In the next shot, all three rows are locked down.",    "FAIR: Many of the animals are depicted inaccurately, but this can be explained within the storyline - the InGen scientists have made mistakes or deliberate alterations to the species they cloned.

Then when Muldoon is looking at the Raptor footprints she does not have them on.",   "CONT: When the crew first steps onto the platform to look down at the velociraptors, there is an area rug where they are to stand. Moments later, the rug has vanished.",        "CONT: As the Ford Explorers first arrive at the visitor center, (in a long shot) you see Lex walk to the front Explorer. Then, in a close-up (through the windows of the front Explorer), you see her walk up to it again.",      "FAKE: When the Dilophosaurus first spits at Nedry on the hill, there is nothing on his jacket - the poisonous substance is actually in Nedry's hand, and he smears it on his jacket himself.",   "CONT: The bag of money Nedry is holding disappears between shots when Dodgson shows him the canister.",  "CONT: During the introduction ride, where it is shown and explained how the dinos are made, you hear the recorded voice saying the genetically engineered dino DNA is put into unfertilized ostrich eggs - but moments later we see a baby velociraptor hatching from what appears to be an actual dinosaur egg.",         "FAKE: In the scene where the T. rex comes out of its area and walks in front of Dr. Grant and Dr. Malcolm's Explorer, the car and the camera move every time the dinosaur steps, as if to simulate small \"earthquakes\", but the Jurassic Park logo hanging from the mirror doesn't move at all.",       "FAIR: If Site B was where the dinosaurs were bred (In _The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)_ (qv)) then why was the velociraptor born on Isla Nublar? Hammond wanted to create the illusion that all of the animals were, in fact, created on Isla Nublar. It isn't until The Lost World that it was revealed that Site B on Isla Sorna was where the large industrial compound producing thousands of embryos for a single viable one was located. This is explained in the novel but not mentioned in any of the movies.",  "FAKE: The trailer at the archaeological dig where Hammond meets Grant and Sattler is no doubt a (highway-legal) 8 feet in width as seen from the outside, but the \"champagne\" scene which follows takes place in a cavernous mock-up much wider to accommodate workbenches, a full-size refrigerator, etc.",    "FAIR: In the scene in the control room where Mr. Arnold says that \"fences are failing all over the park\", you can clearly see on the computer screen that the raptor paddock fences are included. Later John asks \"the raptor fences aren't out are they?\" Mr. Arnold tells him that they are still on. However, earlier in the movie it was stated that the velociraptors had to be contained in a separate holding pen - which is shown in the movie - away from the paddock shown on the map.",        "FAIR: The \"Dilophosaurus\" in the film had a retractable frill around its neck and was able to spit poison, aiming for the eyes to blind and paralyze its prey. While there is no evidence to support this representation, in the film it's stated when the group is on the tour and approach the holding facility of the Dilophosaurus, the announcer states that recently, they discovered that the venom and the frill were part of what it was capable of. Meaning, clearly the \"facts\" were just simply exaggerated for the film, since they came upon discovering this through bringing it to life, when, outside of the film, of course that never happened. It was probably added for dramatic effect for the later scene when Dennis would encounter the dinosaur.",        "PLOT: It is quite unlikely that a really important room like the control room doesn't have a manual (or at least an independently powered) lock which would be operational in the event of a power outage.",      "PLOT: When Tim and Lex arrive at the visitor center, after their \"tour\", they find a entire buffet set with desserts. But all personnel left the night before and only the people in the control-room have been around. Hammond and Ellie ate dessert the night before, but it should have gone bad or melted until the children arrived. No staff of the kitchen seem present or around either. To leave all this food out seem without logic. Especially since no one has eaten from it or intend to do so.",    "CONT: During the helicopter ride Hammond has his back obviously towards the front and is sitting on the left side.

When the helicopter lands Hammond is on the right side with Gennaro across from him.",     "CONT: Before Tim and Lex are attacked by the T. rex the seat belt holder next to the door is in place where it should be. In the next shot the holder is not there, just a hole in the plastic interior of the car.",     "CONT: Tim's left ear is bloody from the electrocution he suffered (probably a blown eardrum), and it's visible in the buffet scene, but when they are evading the velociraptors his ear is devoid of blood, and his hair is pretty well styled (as opposed to being frizzy from the frying).",    "FAIR: When Hammond shows the guests the park lab, shortly after the scene involving Mr. DNA, Gennaro mistakenly refers to the park scientists as \"autoerotica\". This is an obvious joke at Gennaro's expense.",         "FAKE: When Dennis slides down the bank (waterfall) you can see a section of it that has been cut to make a sort of slide for him to go down. It is unlikely to be a storm gutter, plus Dennis manages to slip exactly where it is.",      "FAKE: When Gennaro leaves the driver-side door open and runs away, Timmy goes to close the door and you can see the cover for the seat belt next to the driver-side window but no seat belt is visible. Once Timmy closes the door and you look out the driver-side window, the cover is missing; all you see is the opening where the cover would be installed.",         "FAKE: When the Jeep is being chased by the T-Rex, the camera goes to the driver's side mirror showing the T-Rex and \"Objects in mirror are closer than they appear\". This phrase is only needed for mirrors with convex glass (used to allow the driver to have a wider viewing range and found on the passenger side of the vehicle), which the driver's side mirror does not have (it uses a piece of flat glass).",     "FAKE: During lunch, the characters eat in a round room with projectors displaying slides on the opposite wall, around the room. The diners and the wait staff would be in the projector beams, but cast no shadows on the screens. The images are obviously rear-projection.",    "CONT: When they arrive at the T. rex cage right before the black out, we can clearly see the ground inside the cage is approximately flush with that outside the cage. But when the T. rex escapes and begins to terrorize the two trucks, the ground in the cage is shown to be at least 100 feet below where it was before.",    "CHAR: As Dr. Grant lectures the cynical boy at the dig site about the velociraptor, he says that the velociraptor's claw was used to eviscerate and tear its victims apart, as opposed to going for the neck like many of today's predators. The fossilized remains of a velociraptor caught in a feud with its prey clearly show the velociraptor stabbing the prey in the neck with its claw. _\"The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs\" (2005)_ (qv) also conducted an experiment to see if the claw could eviscerate flesh. It couldn't.",    "FAIR: Dr. Grant is shown at the beginning of the film excavating a velociraptor in Montana. True velociraptors have only been found in central Asia, but Montana was home to the closely related Deinonychus, which some paleontologists considered to be the same as Velociraptor at the time the original Jurassic Park novel was written. For the movie, they kept the incorrect name.",         "CONT: In the trailer / champagne scene, the amount of dust on Grant's forehead changes between between shots from 3/4 covered to fully covered, back to 3/4 and finally none.",  "CREW: When Dr. Grant and Tim are choosing which car to sit in at the visitors center two stage lights can be seen reflecting in the open car door.",     "FAKE: As the Ford Explorer that has just chased Grant and Tim down the tree topples over and smashes onto the floor, the huge tree root on the right of the shot moves showing it's not a tree root at all and doesn't go into the ground it's just resting on the floor.",        "FAKE: In the scene where the T. rex flips the Jeep over the viewer can see a floodlight in the background being hidden by a tree. The tree which hides the light still sits in a large pot, although it should be planted.",      "FAKE: When the T. rex spins the upside down Explorer, in one shot a wire is visible connected to the vehicle. It is in the shot where the animatronics legs are visible.",       "FAKE: When the T. rex attacks the herd of Gallimimus, one of them leaps up toward the T. rex and the Gallimimus' top half disappears into the T. rex' body for a second.",       "CREW: When Dr. Grant is holding the door shut in the control room, just as the velociraptor pushes the door almost fully open you can see a crew member in a white shirt reflected in the glass opposite the door. The crew member seems to be pushing the velociraptor model against the door to force it open.",         "CONT: When the T. rex breaks out through the fence its first move shows it walking in between the two explorers away from the characters, which would give it no cause to have any interest with the explorers. In the following scene, the T. rex is shown at the fence again.",         "PLOT: The plot centers around finding dinosaur blood in fossilized mosquitoes trapped in amber. However, our first encounter with extinct life comes when Ellie examines a leaf and says \"This 'veriforman' species has been extinct since the Cretaceous.\" No mechanism is provided for how they could have cloned the plants, given that mosquitoes don't drink plant juices. It is possible that DNA could have been extracted from the amber (hardened tree-sap), but this still doesn't account for other types of plants, such as ferns and bushes.",         "FAKE: SPOILER: As the T. rex rears its head up with the Velociraptor in its mouth, the raptor disappears completely for just a moment, then pops back into view.",       "FAIR: When leaving the visitor coach to proceed to the laboratory, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, and Dr. Malcolm have to push hard to lift their retaining clips which keep them on their seats during the ride, yet Hammond and Gennaro are able to lift theirs easily. As shown earlier, Hammond is holding the remote control for the seat restraints; all he had to do was push a button to release the locks.",      "SYNC: As Hammond was hearing the shotgun fire through the telephone, we can hear that what was firing was like a pistol the bangs and the rate of fire. Shotguns usually have a slower rate of fire and sound far more louder than a pistol, and when the shot goes to the glass behind the \"ride\" it looked like holes from 9mm pistol rounds instead of .12 guage shotgun rounds.",     "SYNC: When the T. rex is attacking the car with Lex and Tim, in a shot through the roof wind-shield, you can hear them scream. However, their mouths stay closed.",      "PLOT: When the T. rex first gets out, it claws open the fence and walks through the opening; however, when Dr. Grant and Lex go through the same spot in the fence, there is a significant drop (large enough for a jeep to drop past them and into a tree that Dr. Grant then climbs to rescue Tim). The dropoff that Dr. Grant and the kids scale down would have made the fence too tall for the T. rex to reach or even see.",  "FACT: The mosquito that is encased in amber, and from which the DNA sample is extracted is male. This is evident from the \"bushy\" look of the antennae. Female mosquitoes have far fewer hairs on their antennae, and so the distinction is easily made. Only females drink blood, as it is needed to produce eggs. There would not have been any dinosaur DNA in the male to extract.",  "CONT: During the tour group's first stop at the tyrannosaur paddock, rain appears and disappears from the vehicle windows between shots.",       "FAKE: From the control room, Hammond sees Malcolm speaking to him through a surveillance camera apparently mounted in the vehicle. Interior shots of the vehicles, however, show no evidence of cameras anywhere in the vehicles, particularly the part that Malcolm appears to have been looking at. Early concept art for the film did show where the cameras would be, but the final design does not appear to include them.",   "FAKE: A number of obvious goofs from the Dilophosaurus sequence: - Before it opens up its frill, you can see nothing on the animal's   neck that would suggest is has a frill. It simply appears from one   shot to the next. - As the animal opens up its frill, you can see the wire that held   the frill down being quickly pulled back. You can also notice a   curiously narrow area around the neck - that's where the wire was   wrapped around it in the beginning of the shot. - When the frill is fully opened, it flops around a lot. In the next   shot, it is resting firmly on the animal's neck, suggesting it is   either another prop, or has been attached more firmly between   takes.",   "CONT: As the T. rex was destroying the Explorer that Tim and Lex were in, in one shot, their clothes are nice and clean, and the next, they're filthy with mud.", "CREW: The video cameras in front of the steering wheel in the Ford Explorer are actually supposed to be used for the audience to see out the windshield. Even on the front bumper guard, there are video cameras, probably used for crew members to drive the vehicle from behind the backseat. When the camera zooms up to the main Jurassic Park gate, there is clearly a tiny camera on top of the driver's side windshield panel. Ian literally found this camera out after the people were looking at the T. rex paddock.",     "FAKE: When the T. rex flips the car with the children in it over, you can see a plant in a flower pot.",        "SYNC: When Ray Arnold uses the UNIX command prompt to access the park's security system his spoken commands do not match his typed commands. For example the first typed command is \"access security\" and the first spoken command is \"access main program\". None of his spoken commands match the commands entered in the prompt.",   "CHAR: The command prompt used by Ray Arnold while attempting to access security settings appears to have correctly started in normal user mode, as the prompt symbol is simply a \">\" character. He would have to enable superuser mode, often indicated by a \"#\" symbol, to access important system information such as security settings. Perhaps the enable command was \"please.\"",         "FACT: In the first scene where the Ford Explorers pull up and Mr. Hammond brags about the cars, the boy Tim climbs inside and if you look closely you can see there is no seat belts in the vehicle. The restraints were cut because the vehicle could not be involved in a traffic collision due to the track system. Then, when the T. rex flips the Explorer over, the kids do no fall from their seats because they were wearing some sort of restraints.",      "CHAR: In the scripted audio tour, the narrator refers to the dilophosaurus as poisonous, when in fact if the method of toxin exchange is spitting or biting, then it is actually venomous.",     "CONT: As the gas Jeeps travel through the park from the heliport to the visitors center, their tops are configured to be completely open air. As Dr. Grant sees the brachiosaurus for the first time, he reaches up to grab the Jeep's roll bar to stand. The Jeep's canopy covering the front seat passengers is closed. Seconds later when he reaches down the turn Dr. Sattler's head to the left it's open again.",     "FAIR: After shooting the velociraptor, Grant drops the shotgun on the ground, with the action open and the ejection port facing up. There is a shell visible halfway out of the receiver. This is probably why Grant stops trying to shoot the attacking raptors and drops the gun, precisely because of this \"stovepipe\" jam (assuming that he is not accustomed to firearms and therefore doesn't know racking the action would probably solve the problem).",   "FAKE: When Muldoon, Ellie, and Malcolm are being chased by the T. rex, the rex moves towards Malcolm (seated in the back) and Malcolm leans back fast in fright, moving the gear stick from fourth to third gear. This should have slowed the Jeep and made the engine rev up. Neither happens.", "FAKE: When the T. rex chase starts, the camera angle changes to Muldoon changing gears in the Jeep. It appears that he changes gears from second to first, not vice versa.",      "CONT: As Alan Grant gazes at the herd of brachiosaurus, he's sitting on the ground between Ellie Sattler and John Hammond. But in a reverse-angle shot showing the three characters in the foreground and the dinosaurs in the distance, Ellie is standing between Hammond and Grant.",   "CONT: Ellie makes a break for the maintenance shed. She jumps over a log and the shed can be seen in the distance. She then swings from a branch and then jumps over the same log again. Evidently, this was a different take as the shed is virtually lost in the fog effects.",  "CREW: When Dr. Grant, Lex, and Tim have just climbed up the tree where they'll meet the brachiosaurus, there's a scaffold visible in the background on the left just behind a horizontal branch. In a later scene, when they are asleep and just about to wake up, the net used to hang distant branches and leaves is clearly visible in the top third of the frame for almost the full width. Below that, once again the scaffold silhouetted against the background light.",     "CREW: During the Gallimimus stampede when Grant, Lex, and Tim seek shelter under the fallen tree, you can see the shadow of a camera or crew member on Grant's body a few seconds before the T. rex appears.",    "CONT: Dr. Grant clearly isn't wearing a watch during the helicopter ride to the island, but is wearing one as soon as they land and for the rest of the film.",  "FAKE: When Grant and the children are approached by the brachiosaurus in the tree, there is a shot where you see Tim's stand-in from behind, who has straight, and significantly longer, hair.",         "CONT: While Muldoon is on the ground, attempting to save Jophrey's life, his hat is missing, but when he gives the order to shoot the raptor, the hat mysteriously appears on his head.",         "CONT: When the T. rex flips over the Ford Explorer it hits the wall but in the next scene when the T. rex stands on it, the Explorer has moved away from the wall by several feet.",     "FAKE: There is an absence of blood on the shredded harness used to hold the cow after it has been fed to the raptors, despite the violence of the feeding scene.",       "CREW: A wire can be seen behind the Dilophosaurus when it spreads its neck frills, before it attacks Dennis Nedry.",     "FAKE: In the kitchen scene, you can see the reflection of various shiny objects on the metallic tables through the reflection of the raptors. This wouldn't be possible, unless the raptors were see-through.",  "FAKE: When the T. rex slams the side of the car with the kids, and later slams the side of the escaping jeep with Malcolm in the back, there is no visible damage to the vehicles.",      "CONT: When Dennis jeep get stuck he notices a sign telling him which way to the docks, in the first shot the arrow is pointing up. A few seconds later when Dennis falls down and proceeds into the jungle to attach the cable, the arrow is pointing to the left.",      "CONT: When the T. rex roars right by the jeep door, Timmy not only does not react to the earsplitting sound, he's not even looking at the rex. The scene then quickly cuts to a closeup of him cowering in terror.",      "FACT: Dr. Grant tests the electric fence by throwing a wooden branch at it. This would not reveal whether or not the electric fence is active because wood is an insulator and does not conduct electricity.",   "CONT: When Nedry opens the shaving cream can to steal the embryos he tosses the top section of the can aside. When he is finished collecting the embryos the discarded section is on a shelf in front of him.",   "FAKE: When Grant and the children are sitting in the tree overlooking the Brachiosaurs, and again when climbing the electric fence, the soles of Grant's boots can be seen and are completely clean and free of any mud or debris.",      "CONT: Before the T. rex attacks Tim and Lex in the car, the exterior shot shows the previously open door closed, but, when the camera changes to inside the vehicle, Tim closes the door and gains the attention of the T. rex.",         "CONT: The label on the champagne bottle changes position at least three times as Hammond pours.",       "CONT: When Dennis bumps open the main \"Jurassic Park\" gate, the CB antenna on the right rear of the Jeep is straight up.

In the next shot of the T. rex it is letting go of the nudge much lower down, from the door itself.",      "CONT: The sky in the first Brachiosaur scene is alternately cloudy and clear from shot to shot.",        "CONT: Malcolm goes from leaning in on Grant and Ellie's conversation in the cinema to sitting further away in the next shot.",  "CONT: The swing-arm behind the raptor egg disappears.",         "CONT: Grant moves forward to look at the Gallimimus herd but in the next shot he's just started moving.",        "FAKE: An obvious stuntman when Grant falls from the dinosaur skeleton in the Visitors Centre.",         "CHAR: A lot of the characters call the dinosaurs \"he\" even though Dr Wu told Malcolm the dinosaurs are all female.",  "CONT: When Grant is lecturing the group in Montana, the man working the computer is looking at the monitor and then at Grant from shot to shot.",        "FACT: Dominican amber is famous for its quality, but it was only formed 20 million years ago, long after the dinosaurs had died out, so you could never find a prehistoric mosquito that had fed on dinosaur blood there, and even then, one that was completely uncontaminated, which would have been amplified along with the DNA, as well as too degraded. There is nothing to compare it with.",        "PLOT: Dr Wu claims \"all vertebrate embryos are inherently female\". This is inaccurate. In fact, it would have made more sense to breed the dinosaurs all-male, because there are far fewer variables, and may have eliminated the danger of breeding altogether.",      "PLOT: The ride they are taken on passes by the lab, there is only one viewport and the ride seats only a few people (30ish) yet they expect many thousands per day. This will be impossible.",    "CHAR: Grant says; \"T-Rex doesn't want to be fed. He wants to hunt. Can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct\".

At the latitude of Costa Rica, tropical storms move east to west. The storm should have moved away from the island.",    "FAKE: Obvious fake monitors where the raptors jump on the table and disturb them.",     "CHAR: During his dig in Montana, Grant makes three mistakes: First, he unearths a velociraptor in Montana. Velociraptor remains have only been found in Asia. Second, he declares that velociraptor was a pack hunter. All velociraptor remains have been found alone, indicating exactly the opposite. Both of these, however, are accurate claims about Deinonychus, on which Michael Crichton modeled his velociraptors. Thirdly, Grant says that raptor means \"bird of prey.\" It is actually Latin for thief. (The English word rape has the same root, and originally meant theft.) The first velociraptors were found around egg nests, and paleontologists thought it was an oviraptor (egg thief). They subsequently concluded that the eggs were in fact velociraptor eggs, indicating that the animals cared for their young, rather than abandoning them, as many had previously thought.",  "CHAR: When Grant is holding the baby raptor, he asks Dr. Wu, \"What species is this?\" and receives the reply, \"Uh, it's a velociraptor.\" In fact, \"velociraptor\" is the genus of the animal, not the species.",     "PLOT: In the final scene with the T Rex and velociraptors in the exhibition hall, there are no doors large enough in the building to allow entry by the T Rex.",         "CONT: At the end when Alan, Ellie, Lex and Tim jump on to the dinosaur skeletons to escape, Ellie jumps on the tail end and it breaks off and begins spinning with her on it.

Whilst Hammond is showing off his dinosaur 'theme park' to a selected audience [a lawyer (Gerrano), mathematician (Malcolm), dino expert (Grant), paleobotanist (Sattler) and his grandchildren (Tim & Lex)], Nedry (computer expert) disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos. This enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures... On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park -- and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results.", "by" : "Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com>" } ], "taglines" : [  "Life finds a way.",     "Remember.

While in current naval tradition a flagship requires an admiral on board, Starfleet has been established as having a premier starship referred to as a \"flagship.\" In _\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" (1987)_ (qv), the Enterprise 1701-D was referred to as the Flagship of the Federation.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: In the final \"Spock on Spock\" scene, you can see the obvious height difference between the two. Young Spock should be the same height as old Spock. However, Vulcan biology is not fully understood and this could simply be a natural physical change. Additionally, this is consistent with human physiology. Old Spock is 120 years older than young Spock so it is natural that young Spock is taller. As humans age, their spines become more curved and the cartilage in between the vertebrae become more compacted; hence they tend to be shorter. This height difference can be quite considerable so a handful of inches is really not unusual. In addition, it should also be noted that both the actors, 'Leonard Nimoy' (qv) and 'Zachary Quinto' (qv), both stand the exact same height in real life, 6'1\". So the height difference on-screen could be intentional, to show the aging of Older Spock.",  "CONT: When Kirk first lands on the drill, he removes his helmet and throws it to the side and engages a Romulan in hand-to-hand combat.

In Russian, there is no \"W\" sound, but there is a very, very common \"V\" sound (although heavily rounded with shades of \"w\"). As a result of this, his labored way of transforming his V's into W's might seem incorrect, but when speaking English, native Russian speakers will sometimes transpose V's and W's, e.g. \"Ve are wery happy to be here\". (A similar phenomenon is seen in speakers of Asian languages that possess only either \"L\" or \"R\", when speaking in English will often transpose them: \"really\" becomes \"leary\".) In any event, this is clearly a nod to 'Walter Koenig (I)' (qv)'s portrayal of Chekov in the original _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) series and most notably in _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)_ (qv), when Chekov is seen in 20th Century San Francisco asking for directions to \"nuclear wessels\".",      "FAIR: Mr. Scott says he had a transporter mishap with \"Admiral Archer's prized beagle\". The series _\"Enterprise\" (2001)_ (qv) with Archer was set around 100 years before the events of the movie. The Scotty scene takes place in 2258. Enterprise was set in 2151-2155 meaning Archer would be around 140-150 years old. _Star Trek (2009)_ (qv) writer 'Roberto Orci' (qv) went on record to clear up the issue: \"Admiral Archer is a reference to the Archer we all know and love, from the TV series and yes he would be over 100, which is a likely life expectancy in a futuristic space faring race of humans\" (as depicted by McCoy in _\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" (1987) {Encounter at Farpoint (#1.1)}_ (qv).)",       "FAKE: When Kirk is making out with Uhura's green skinned roommate Gaila, you can see green make-up on the front of his boxers (and a little on his skin above the boxers) when he first lifts himself from on top of her for some dialog.

Before it started to attack Vulcan, there was another \"lightning storm in space\"; this was the arrival of Spock Prime's vessel, the Jellyfish.",       "FAIR: In _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv), Captain Kirk mentions a Federation/Romulan War many years previously. The war was conducted through starship battles and the treaty for it was negotiated via subspace radio, so Romulans and Federation citizens never saw each other prior to that point in time. This means that the Federation knew about the Romulans and general background information about their ships (what radio frequencies were used, power signatures, etc.) long before the scene with the USS Kelvin in the movie which resulted in altering later history.",   "FAIR: SPOILER: Some viewers have commented that the Nero/Spock confrontation that sends them through the black hole occurred immediately following the destruction of Romulus. The comic series \"Star Trek: Countdown\" makes it clear that there was a time passage of around a week or so, during which Nero upgraded his ship significantly with BORG technology as part of his revenge scheme. Although comic co-writer Mike Johnson considers Countdown to be canon, screenwriter Robert Orci has stated he is no position to declare whether it is, though he feels it could be considered canon unless it is contradicted in a later film or TV episode. However, he has since implied that it was not canon.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: Chekov obtained transporter lock on Kirk and Sulu because the transponders in their communicators helped him lock onto their biosignal, which was moving at a predictable velocity. However, losing transporter lock on Spock's mother was a different story. Whether from the lack of communicators or Vulcan's unique geology, transporter lock on the Science Council was only possible above ground. Unlike with Kirk and Sulu, her fall was a complete surprise, and her biosignal was masked by interference from the cliff walls and the debris engulfing her body. In addition, while Amanda clearly demonstrated that people can move within the field of a transport in progress, she literally fell out of the transport-in-progress's field when the cliff collapsed. She was already being molecularly disassembled for transport. Compare this to Kirk and Sulu's transport; in that instance, Kirk and Sulu were already in motion and Chekov was already working on maintaining the lock while Kirk and Sulu were transported aboard.",      "CONT: In the high altitude parachute jump, the display on Chekov's screen showing the order of jumpers (Olson, Kirk, Sulu) does not match actual order (Kirk, Olson, Sulu) until the first chutes deploy.",      "FAIR: SPOILER: Spock Prime is surprised that Kirk is not yet Captain of the Enterprise. In his time line, he served under Captain Pike's command of the Enterprise for ten years, and Kirk became Captain after that time. He should know that Kirk is too young to be Captain. However Spock may not know the actual date yet - so far he's been abducted by Nero and abandoned on a planet near Vulcan, and although he's aware of a nearby Starfleet outpost, he's not been there yet.",  "CONT: When they plan to sneak up on the Narada, Mr. Scott is holding a towel with both hands, but when they zoom up closer, he is holding it to his side.",      "CONT: SPOILER: During the awards ceremony, several flags can be seen in the background, including what appears to be the state flag of California. Towards the end of the sequence, the point of view shifts to Spock Prime viewing from a balcony, and the flags are changed to Federation and Starfleet flags.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: When Nero is accused of genocide after destroying Vulcan, he responds that he is trying to prevent it. He knows he has gone back in time, and he has the red matter, which he knows can destroy the supernova. He also knows from his own actions that it's possible to change the time line he is from. If he truly wants to prevent genocide, why does he not go to the star and eliminate it decades before it can destroy Romulus? This is in part because Nero also states that he wishes to eliminate the Federation since it is the primary nemesis of Romulus. Nero may have decided to destroy the Federation before saving his home world, since the supernova is not scheduled to take place for a hundred years. (It should also be noted that Nero is not exactly a picture of mental health, after having witnessed the destruction of his entire planet, travelling through a black hole and spending upwards of 25 years in prison, plotting revenge. Therefore any logical flaws in what he says can always just be put down to his tenuous grip on sanity.)",      "FAIR: Uhura claims to be able to speak three dialects of Romulan. It has been established that relations between the Romulans and the Federation have never been friendly and that the only contact was to negotiate a peace. However, there's no reason to presume that their unfriendliness precluded either side learning the other's language somehow. There would be an immense tactical, political, and diplomatic advantage to figuring it out. (It is quite reasonable that, despite the conflict, one side would learn the other's language. In _\"Star Trek\" (1966) {The Enterprise Incident (#3.2)}_ (qv), while Romulan Commander Liliana Charvanek is speaking with Captain Kirk, she remarks, \"Your language has always been most difficult for me, Captain,\" implying that they are not employing the Universal Translator, which must mean that she has studied and mastered English.)",       "FAIR: According to the writers, the new Stardate system has the year and the decimal points indicate the day (i.e. Stardate 2258.42 is February 11, 2258). However, at the beginning of the film, Captain Robau says the Stardate is \"twenty-two thirty-three zero four\". This does not fit into the new system, as he only gives one placeholder zero instead of two or none (it should have been Stardate 2233.4). However, the Stardate system is essentially separating the two numbers. 2233.0000004 would have been correct. But if you want to hold them to a standard, then every Stardate should be four digits, then three, meaning every Stardate in the movie is wrong. This means the Captain was correct.",     "FAIR: SPOILER: By destroying Vulcan, Nero does not prevent the development of red matter. The development of red matter was in his timeline and his timeline remains unchanged.",        "CONT: When Kirk, McCoy and Uhura rush onto the bridge to inform the captain that they are racing into a Romulan trap, Kirk runs towards the captain and Uhura runs to stand right next to Spock. When the camera angle changes, Uhura is not standing next to Spock but about 5 feet to the left of him.",         "CONT: When McCoy and Kirk board a shuttle headed for the Enterprise, there are nacelles visible on the bottom of the hull. However, when it pulls out to reveal the Enterprise in orbit, the nacelles are on the top of the hull.",       "FAIR: In the fight on the drill's platform, which is at an extremely high altitude, Kirk and Sulu remove their helmets. On Earth, humans would find it very difficult to breathe at that height without supplemental oxygen; in Trek mythology, Vulcan's atmosphere is thinner than Earth's. It was an acceptable practice, when visiting or residing on Vulcan, to receive an injection of a Tri-ox compound to assist in breathing (_\"Star Trek\" (1966) {Amok Time (#2.1)}_ (qv)). Knowing that they would be fighting on Vulcan at a high altitude, it seems logical that the away team would be given a similar injection (considering McCoy's penchant for injecting Kirk on the fly), though it was not shown on screen.",      "FAIR: When Kirk convinces Pike and Spock that they are heading into a trap as they warp towards Vulcan, Kirk refers to '47 Klingon Warbirds destroyed by Romulans.' Though \"Warbirds\" are usually Romulan vessels within the _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) canon, the same name has been used for Klingon vessels even in the original timeline, e.g. in _Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)_ (qv).",      "FAIR: The deep crevasse that the young James Kirk dumps the corvette into is not a natural canyon (which are not generally found in Iowa) but a rock quarry.",   "CHAR: When Captain Pike is talking to Kirk in the bar, he says \"You understand what the Federation is, don't you? It's important. It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada.\" However, here he is describing Starfleet and not the Federation. The Federation is an interplanetary government like the United States (a Federal form of government), while Starfleet is the \"peacekeeping and humanitarian\" force.",  "CONT: The Starfleet logo, the distinctive \"arrow-head\" that featured on all the teasers, was originally intended by the production designers of the original _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) series to be the \"assignment patch\" for crew on the Enterprise only. This was reflected on-screen by the use of different patches for different ships or posts. The use of the arrowhead insignia on the Kelvin, before Nero arrives in the past, is therefore a continuity error since history had not yet been altered.",     "FAIR: During Chekov's announcement to the crew during the voyage to Vulcan, he leans over to his left (towards Sulu) when talking about the \"lightning storm in space.\" When Kirk replays the footage of this, Chekov shifts and leans slightly to his right (what would be away from Sulu, if from the viewpoint of the view screen) during this line. The replay of Chekov is reversed, as shown by the location of Captain Pike's knee behind Chekov. In the live version, Pike's knee is correctly on the audience's right. In the replay, Pike's black pant leg is seen on the left. Thus the replay of the video is correct.",         "FACT: Saturn's moon Titan orbits in the plane of the rings, but when the Enterprise rises out of the atmosphere of Titan, the view looks down on the rings.",    "CREW: When Ayel lifts Kirk by the throat you can see wires pulling Kirk up.",   "FAKE: Characters are seen taking the turbo-lift DOWN to the engineering deck of the USS Kelvin. However the exterior shots clearly show the engineering hull is ABOVE the saucer section, where the bridge etc. is located.",    "CHAR: SPOILER: Kirk's statement to the crew that Spock had resigned his commission was incorrect. He was not giving up his rank of Commander, he was stepping down as Captain of the ship. At the end when he is talking to Spock Prime about leaving Starfleet, then he would have resigned his commission.",     "CONT: During the space jump, Chekov reports the away team's altitude every few seconds. His first report gives an altitude of about 20,000 meters, however, the head-up display in front of him shows an altitude of over 100,000 meters. The away team's descent could not possibly have covered about 80,000 meters in such a short period of time. Later reports in the scene show the altitude to be more accurate.",   "CREW: SPOILER: The shadow of the camera is visible on Spock Prime's back near the end of the movie.",    "CONT: SPOILER: When Spock enters the Bridge to become Kirk's first officer in the final scene (after Kirk relieves Pike), he steps off the Turbolift and steps behind a glossy panel. The panel reflects the face of one of the bridge crew: a woman whose red hair is bound up in a weird bun-like do. In the reflection her shirt is red. When the camera switches to the full bridge view, she is wearing blue.",        "CONT: When the Narada first attacks the Enterprise upon its arrival at Vulcan, its missiles impact the Enterprise on the Port (left) side of the \"neck\" connecting the Primary (saucer) and Secondary (Engineering) hulls. However, when Kirk is ejected onto Delta Vega from an airlock in the same general area where the missile impact occurred, there is no sign of any battle damage.",     "CONT: After the Narada comes through the black hole the next shot shows the bridge of the Kelvin and the red alert klaxon is playing. Next, the helmsman says \"I have a reading, they've locked weapons on us.\" The captain then announces red alert even though the klaxon is already playing.",       "CONT: SPOILER: When Spock is beamed away from Spock Prime's ship at the end of the movie he is in a sitting position, but when he materializes on the transporter pad he is in a standing position.",     "CONT: SPOILER: In the end when Spock and Spock Prime are talking, their positions relative to the ships in the hangar change several times between shots.",      "PLOT: When Kirk and crew are devising their plan, Spock says he can board the Narada and \"steal back\" the black hole device. At this time, only Kirk knew that the device was in fact stolen.",        "FAKE: When Kirk and Spock beam aboard the Romulan vessel Spock leans down to perform a mind meld on one of the fallen Romulans. You can clearly see Spock's right hand with a deep scratch revealing RED blood as opposed to green.",     "CONT: During the countdown at the beginning of the movie when Captain Kirk is on the collision course, as it counts down from 18 seconds, it actually takes longer for it to impact than 18 seconds.",    "CONT: In the opening scene, when Captain Robau of the Kelvin says \"Polarize the view screen\" you can see he is wearing a Starfleet badge. As he turns and sits down in the captains chair, it has disappeared, but returns again in the next scene.",   "CONT: When Chekov is briefing the crew on his plan to catch up to the Narada, there is a close-up shot of Bones turned to his left listening with Sulu standing off to his left side. The next shot of everybody standing around shows Bones angled more to the right and Sulu is behind him.",   "CONT: In the fight scene between Nero and Kirk, Nero's injured ear and scars change sides from right to left. In the next scene involving Nero, it is corrected.",       "CONT: When Kirk and Bones are exchanging introductions on the shuttle the day Kirk enlists in Starfleet, the position of Kirk's shoulder belts changes between shots.",   "SYNC: During Spock and Kirk's fight on the bridge, Spock slams Kirk into one of the bridge consoles, which makes a cracking sound like it had been broken by Kirk's impact. When the console is shown again, there is no damage.",       "CONT: When the USS Kelvin is attacked by the Narada, the front half of the saucer section suffers a lot of damage. However, when Ayel appears on the viewscreen after the attack, there is no damage or debris to the saucer section as seen through the windows of the bridge.",  "FAIR: When Uhura walks in on Kirk and Gaila, she says, \"I've been working on solar systems.\" While we refer to our own star system as \"The Solar System\", it is not in the least bit incorrect to refer to any other star system as \"a solar system\". The difference is in the use of \"The\" as opposed to \"A\". A \"solar system\" is simply a planetary system that orbits a star and so Uhura is quite correct in her wording.",         "FAIR: The female Vulcan Minister is smiling as she stands up at Spock's entrance hearing for the Science Academy. However, this is not necessarily an emotional response - smiling can be used to convey approval of a situation (as well as dozens of other meanings), therefore the minister may simply be smiling to signify support of Spock.", "CONT: When Captain Robau is shown at the beginning of the film, the Starfleet insignia on his uniform disappears and reappears again as Robau enters the bridge and sits in his chair. It also happens again when the Narada emerges and attacks the Kelvin.",    "FAKE: Green-skinned Gaila has a white scalp where her hair is parted.",         "FAIR: SPOILER: When Spock Prime is contacted by Nero following the destruction of Romulus, Nero's appearance is not the appearance of a normal Romulan from that timeline. Instead Nero already has the facial tattoos and shaved head consistent with the Romulan mourning ritual, although Nero and his crew should not have performed this ritual until after the attack on the Kelvin - in which the Romulan appearance should also be original time-line appearance. This is often thought to be a mistake, but the events that take place in the original timeline circa 2387 that are described in Spock Prime's mind meld take place over the course of several months and are told out of order in the mind meld - an effort by the filmmakers to simply the exposition for a general audience. This effort to simply the exposition leads these type of confusions. Romulus was actually destroyed while Spock Prime was on Vulcan trying to convince the Vulcan government of the threat and that his plan to collapse the super nova with Red Matter would work (and that the whole supernova thing wasn't part of a Romulan/Federation Cold War ploy). After Romulus was destroyed, the Jellyfish ship and the plan was set in motion. The collapse of the supernova happened weeks after the destruction of Romulus (during which time Nero and his crew got the mourning tattoos, had his ship refitted to become the monster ship with the Borg technology that is seen in the film, battled 24th century Starfleet and Klingon fleets, etc.). Another thing that is unclear in the film is that after collapsing the supernova, Ambassador Spock created a second smaller black hole that he modified into a temporal vortex through which he intended to travel to go back in time a few months and collapse the Hobus star before it ever went nova and thus save Romulus; however, before his small ship was pulled into the temporal vortex by its gravity, Nero arrived and his ship being of larger mass was pulled in first. Nero's ship not having been a part of Ambassador Spock's calculations completely comprised the intended effect and Nero traveled back in time 154 years and Ambassador Spock ended up traveling back 129 years (into the altered time-line).",       "FAIR: There are no mountain ranges anywhere in Iowa, yet one appears clearly visible behind Kirk while approaches the Starfleet base to join up.  However, on the DVD/Blu-ray's additional content, the filmmakers are actually aware of this, and joke about \"the geography in the future\" being different.",   "CHAR: When Spock requests permission to come on the bridge, he says, \"Permission to come aboard, Captain.\" He is in fact already on board the Enterprise. Protocol requires that he should have requested permission to be allowed on the command bridge, as he is not a command officer nor bridge personnel at that moment.",  "FAIR: When Chekov beams Kirk and Sulu onto the transporter pad from their free-fall, they hit the pad hard enough to send (badly animated) shards from the pad into the air, as well as cracking noises. However, when the pad is shown again, there is no damage whatsoever. The shards from the pad are actually the transporter beams \"breaking\" apart as they hit the floor. While there is a distinct breaking sound, one can assume that this is the noise of the beams as this hasn't happened before nor has it happened again (yet).",    "CONT: In the first scene with Mr. Scott at his desk in the outpost, the x-ray machine as seen over his left shoulder is pointing forward, yet moments later when he stands up, it is pointing to the right.",     "CONT: SPOILER: When Kirk helps Pike off the torture table on the Narada, he supports Pike on his left side. But when they're beamed aboard Enterprise, Pike is standing on Kirk's right.",       "FAIR: The movie's universe diverges from the familiar _\"Star Trek\" (1966)_ (qv) universe in 2233, when Nero arrived in the past, many details of character behavior, technology, terminology, alien culture, etc., were changed.",      "CONT: The USS Kelvin's upper engineering hull has a tapered cylindrical shape in all but one shot. It is clearly spherical in the shot of Captain Robau's shuttle leaving the shuttle bay.",      "CONT: In the opening battle sequence, the computer indicates that weapons are offline but when the crew person gets sucked out through a hull breach soon after, they bang into a firing phaser bank.",  "CONT: Uhura's earrings change color several times throughout the mission. It is highly unlikely that she finds time to change in the midst of an imminent threat to the ship and the Earth.",     "FACT: 1548 squared is 2396304. Not 2396324 as stated in the beginning of the movie.",   "CONT: SPOILER: When Spock and his father Sarek are discussing his mother Amanda's death in the transporter room, one side of the doorway designates the pad as M-1660 while the other side reads M-1330.",       "SYNC: When young Kirk is driving his step father's Corvette and listening to him on the cell phone, you can hear the sound of gears being shifted but his hands never leave the steering wheel. This could not be accomplished on a manual shift Corvette.",       "FACT: SPOILER: When Nero activates the drill over San Francisco, we see Starfleet Academy and many cadets going outside to look at the drill. However, it was established earlier in the film that all cadets were ordered to ships in orbit. Therefore, there shouldn't have been any cadets at Starfleet Academy at that moment.",       "CONT: When Sulu reaches down to rescue Kirk after the fight scene on the drill platform, Kirk is holding on to the edge with his right hand, leaving his left hand free to grasp onto Sulu and be pulled up to safety. However, in the scene immediately following, Sulu is holding Kirk's right hand, while he is clinging to the platform with his left.",       "CONT: When Sarek is speaking to young Spock, the child has a split lip with the suggestion of green blood. Yet you can see the red vasculature of Spock's ears due to the back lighting. Since Vulcans have copper based blood, there should've been a \"green\" tint to the ears, not red as is typical of Iron based human blood. Even with Spock being half human and half Vulcan, there is no way any being would have two distinctly different blood bases." ], "language" : [  "English" ], "locations" : [    "Alaska, USA",  "Bakersfield, California, USA\t(Iowa)",  "Budweiser Brewery/Anheuser-Busch Inc, Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California, USA\t(Enterprise engine room)",        "California State University Northridge - 18111 Nordhoff Street, Northridge, Los Angeles, California, USA\t(Starfleet Academy exterior and courtyard)",   "Dodger Stadium - 1000 Elysian Park Avenue, Chávez Ravine, Elysian Park, Los Angeles, California, USA\t(planet Delta Vega and Romulan Drill)",    "Long Beach City Hall - 333 W.

When the Romulan mining ship Narada attacks the Federation starship USS Kelvin, Lieutenant George Kirk substitutes his captain, who is going to meet the Romulan Captain Nero in his vessel to negotiate a ceasefire, in the command of the Kelvin. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife who is in labor while delivering their son James Tiberius Kirk in the hospital shuttlecraft, George Kirk crashes the Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk grows up and when he meets Captain Christopher Pike in a bar fight, he is invited to join Starfleet.

Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded on the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by old Spock who explains to Kirk that Captain Nero blames Spock and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova.

The sound for a 35mm film is read by a head located about a foot past the projection lamp; so, for the film and sound to remain in perfect sync, the soundtrack for a given frame is located about a foot in front of that frame, that way the image and the sound are projected simultaneously. For the sound and image flashes to occur at the same precise moment, Tyler would thus have to splice the frame of audio onto the reel about a foot further along than he splices the image frame, which he doesn't do (not to mention, it would be impossible to perfectly sync it by hand anyway). However anything we see Tyler doing must be taken with a pinch of salt, since he is just a part of the Narrators imagination.

Tyler and Maria develop a relationship leaving him often on the outside of what is going on. He soon finds that the group is out of control and after a major self-revelation decides there is only one way out. A young urban professional who works for a major car manufacturer can't sleep. Although he doesn't have any of the associated afflictions, he stumbles across support groups as a means to let out whatever emotions he is feeling, which in turn is allowing him to sleep. But the use of these support groups is ruined when he meets a young woman named Marla Singer, who is also going to all these support group meetings. Because he knows she too is not afflicted with any of the maladies for which the groups exist, her presence has lessened the impact of the stories he hears. His life changes when he meets a soap manufacturer named Tyler Durden, who in many ways is the antithesis of the insomniac. Due to unusual circumstances with his own condo, the insomniac moves in with Tyler, who lives in a large dilapidated house in an otherwise abandoned part of town. After a bit of spontaneous roughhousing with Tyler in a bar parking lot, the insomniac finds it becomes a ritual between the two of them, which is helping him cope with the other more difficult aspects of his life. The fights also attract a following, others who not only want to watch but join in. Understanding that there are other men like them, the insomniac and Tyler begin a secret fight club. As the fight club's popularity grows, so does its scope in all aspects. Marla becomes a circle not specifically of the fight clubs but of Tyler and the insomniac's collectives lives. As the nature of the fight clubs becomes out of control in the insomniac's view, the insomniac's life, in association, is one where he no longer understands what is happening around him, or how he can get out of it without harming himself.",  "by" : "Huggo" } ], "taglines" : [      "How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?",         "When you wake up in a different place at a different time, can you wake up as a different person?",      "Losing all hope is freedom",   "Mischief.
